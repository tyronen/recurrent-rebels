'''Digital ecology''' is a science about the interdependence of digital systems and the [[natural environment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title="Digital Ecology : The Complete Guide". June 9, 2022.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This field of study looks at the methods in which digital technologies are changing the way how people interact with the environment, as well as how these technologies affects the environment itself. It is a branch of [[ecology]] that promotes green practices to fight digital pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title="Digital ecology". Philonomist. November 10, 2021.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently the total [[Electronic waste|carbon footprint]] of the internet, our electronic devices, and supporting elements accounts for about 3.7% of global greenhouse gas emissions (including about 1.4 per cent of overall global carbon dioxide emissions).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Mager |first1=David |title=Carbon—Quantifying and Reducing Your Carbon Footprint |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.5848/bk.978-1-60509-468-7_10 |work=Street Smart Sustainability: The Entrepreneur's Guide to Profitably Greening Your Organization's DNA |pages=129–136 |access-date=2023-03-04 |publisher=Berrett-Koehler Publishers, Inc. |last2=Sibilia |first2=Joe|date=2010 |doi=10.5848/bk.978-1-60509-468-7_10 |isbn=978-1-60509-468-7 |url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Digital Ecology can also be used to denote the use of technology in the study of ecological systems and processing, examining how technological developments aid in the collection, analysis and management of ecological data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|access-date=2025-03-04|language=en|title=What is Digital Ecology?|url=https://sites.google.com/view/digitalecology/home/|website=What is Digital Ecology?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Important fields in this aspect of Digital Ecology include the development of drone technology for wildlife monitoring.

Digital ecology is a complex and multifaceted field that requires a holistic approach to understanding the relationship between digital technologies and the natural world. With the increasing reliance on digital technologies, it is important to consider the environmental consequences of these technologies and work towards more sustainable solutions.

== Negative impact on the environment ==
One of the main areas of focus in digital ecology is the impact of [[electronic waste]], or e-waste. As more and more devices become obsolete and are replaced with newer models, the amount of e-waste being produced is increasing at an alarming rate. This e-waste often ends up in landfills, where it can leach harmful chemicals into the soil and water supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|access-date=2023-02-03|author=Andreas. langer@tcodevelopment.com|language=en-US|title=E-waste — a toxic waste stream where valuable finite resources are lost|url=https://tcocertified.com/e-waste/|website=TCO Certified}}&lt;!-- auto-translated by Module:CS1 translator --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Another aspect of digital ecology is the energy consumption of digital technologies and the digital pollution in causes. The production and use of digital devices requires significant amounts of energy, and as the demand for these devices increases, so does the amount of energy required to meet this demand.. The total [[Electronic waste|carbon footprint]] of the internet, our electronic devices, and supporting elements add up to about 3.7% of global greenhouse gas emissions. It is as much as for the airline industry and the number keeps on rising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|access-date=2023-02-03|title=ec0lint|url=https://www.ec0lint.com/blog/introduction-to-digital-ecology|website=www.ec0lint.com}}&lt;!-- auto-translated by Module:CS1 translator --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This increase in energy consumption has a negative impact on the environment, as it contributes to [[climate change]] and [[air pollution]]. Research has shown, that if the internet was a country, it would be the seventh largest polluter in the world, by some estimates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|access-date=2023-02-03|language=en|title=Cognizant BrandVoice: How To Be Both Digital And 'Green' At The Same Time|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/cognizant/2021/09/21/how-to-be-both-digital-and-green-at-the-same-time/|website=Forbes}}&lt;!-- auto-translated by Module:CS1 translator --&gt; {{ugc|date= September 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Digital pollution ===
Digital pollution is a crucial aspect of digital ecology. It is the main problem against which digital ecology is fighting. Digital pollution refers to the negative impact of digital technology and [[electronic waste]] on the environment and human health. This can include emissions from electronic devices, toxic chemicals in electronic waste, and the proliferation of [[e-waste]] in landfills.

Technology users contribute to digital pollution on a daily basis, which include:

* '''[[Cloud storage|Data clouds]] and servers''' - keeping many data on clouds and servers and transferring them contribute to air pollution through the energy used to power and cool these data centers and sending the data. The energy consumption of data centers results in emissions of greenhouse gases, such as harmful carbon dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|access-date=2023-02-03|website=Stanford Magazine|date=2017-06-27|language=en|title=Carbon and the Cloud|url=https://medium.com/stanford-magazine/carbon-and-the-cloud-d6f481b79dfe| via= Medium}}&lt;!-- auto-translated by Module:CS1 translator --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The energy is generated by power plants, which often burn fossil fuels such as [[coal]], [[oil]], and [[natural gas]], releasing harmful pollutants into the air. In addition, the [[air conditioning]] systems used to cool the servers also consume a significant amount of energy and release heat into the environment. This is primarily influenced by large databases, but people's day-to-day activities are also not insignificant. An example of this would be '''storing and accessing emails'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|access-date=2023-02-03|language=en|title=Spam Statistics 2022 |type= blog |url=https://99firms.com/blog/spam-statistics|website=99firms.com}}&lt;!-- auto-translated by Module:CS1 translator --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; An average year of emailing emits about 136 kilograms of {{CO2}}. One inbox consumes enough energy to run a hot shower for about 4 minutes, which is equal to illuminating 40 lightbulbs for an hour and equal to pollution by driving a car 212 metres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|access-date=2023-02-21|language=en|title=Thanks in Advance|url=https://thanks-in-advance.com/|website=Thanks in Advance}} {{verify source|date=September 2024}}&lt;!-- auto-translated by Module:CS1 translator --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Addictionally, [[data center]]s consume large amounts of energy to power and cool the servers that store and process spam email data, resulting in emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|access-date=2023-02-03|language=en|title=A guide to your digital carbon footprint – and how to lower it|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/12/digital-carbon-footprint-how-to-lower-electronics/|website=World Economic Forum|date=9 December 2021 }}&lt;!-- auto-translated by Module:CS1 translator --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Production of electronic devices''' -  has a detrimental effect on the environment for several reasons: increasing the [[demand]] for [[raw material]]s, rare earth minerals, energy, water usage, and other resources, and contribute to [[environmental degradation]] through the associated pollution and waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|access-date=2023-02-03|date=2022-03-24|language=en|title=Are Electronics Bad for the Environment?|url=https://thesustainabilitycooperative.net/2022/03/24/are-electronics-bad-for-the-environment/|website=The Sustainability Co-Op}}&lt;!-- auto-translated by Module:CS1 translator --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Manufacturing is the most polluting phase. It accounts for up to 80% of a device's carbon footprint during its lifetime. Buying new equipment every six years rather than every four reduces [[carbon dioxide]] production by 190&amp;nbsp;kg.
* '''Energy-inefficient electronics -''' they consume more [[electricity]], which in turn requires more energy to be generated, often from power plants that burn [[fossil fuel]]s. Additionally, inefficient electronics also generate more heat, which requires more energy for cooling, further increasing the total energy consumption and associated emissions. When these electronic devices reach the end of their lifespan and are disposed of, they can also become electronic waste, which can release toxic chemicals into the [[Natural environment|environment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference &lt;!-- Citation bot no --&gt;|access-date=2023-02-03|author1=Nihal Sinnadurai | author2= Harry K.

* '''Unnecessary charging of electronic devices -''' can contribute to air pollution through the increased energy consumption. Unnecessary charging of devices, such as [[smartphone]]s or laptops, increases the overall energy demand and contributes to emissions from power plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|access-date=2023-02-03|date=2015-08-10|language=en|title=Learn about Energy and its Impact on the Environment|url=https://www.epa.gov/energy/learn-about-energy-and-its-impact-environment|website= US Environmental Protection Agency}}&lt;!-- auto-translated by Module:CS1 translator --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Charging smartphones generates more [[carbon dioxide]] than charging laptops.
* '''Electronic waste''' -  electronic devices eventually reach the end of their lifespan and become waste. The improper disposal of electronic waste release toxic chemicals into the environment, [[Soil contamination|contaminating soil]] and water, and harming wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|access-date=2023-02-03|language=en|title=E-waste: An Emerging Health Risk|url=https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/programs/geh/geh_newsletter/2014/2/spotlight/ewaste_an_emerging_health_risk_.cfm|website=Global Environmental Health Newsletter}}&lt;!-- auto-translated by Module:CS1 translator --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Positive impact on the environment ==
Despite the environmental impact of electronic devices and data centers, digital technologies positively impact the environment in a variety of ways:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|access-date=2023-02-03|date=2022-01-17|language=en-US|title=Positive Effect Of Information Technology On Environment|url=https://techjournal.org/effect-of-information-technology-on-environment/}}&lt;!-- auto-translated by Module:CS1 translator --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Other uses|Flyover (disambiguation){{!}}Flyover}}

'''Flyover''' is a feature on [[Apple Maps]] that allows users to view certain areas in a [[3D scanning|3D setting]]. Flyover also allows users to take "tours" of these locations through the City Tours feature, showcasing various landmarks in the area. Imagery is provided through the use of planes, which [[Aerial photography|collect]] fine data on buildings.

Initially founded in 2012, along with Apple Maps itself, Flyover now covers over 300 cities, landmarks, and [[national parks|parks]] across five of the six inhabited continents through a series of several expansions, notably in 2014, 2015 and 2019. Despite earlier issues, Flyover has been praised for its detail and uniqueness.&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Bell|first=Karissa|url=https://mashable.com/article/apple-maps-flyover|title=Watch out Google Earth, Apple Maps has a hidden VR-like 'flyover' mode|date=28 June 2017 |publisher=Mashable|accessdate=18 November 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
===2012–2015===
Flyover was announced along with Apple Maps at the [[WWDC 2012]], and was also released alongside Maps in September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://localsplash.com/apple-announces-new-maps-app-at-wwdc-2012?noRedirect=true|title=Apple Announces New Maps App at WWDC 2012|date=11 June 2012 |publisher=Local Splash|accessdate=12 September 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 10 initial cities that first received Flyover were [[Chicago]], [[Copenhagen]], [[Las Vegas]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Miami]], [[Montreal]], [[Sacramento]], [[San Francisco]], [[Seattle]] and [[Sydney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cultofmac.com/173690/here-all-all-the-cities-you-can-flyover-in-ios-6-maps-gallery/|title=Here All All The Cities You Can Flyover In iOS 6 Maps|date=14 June 2012 |publisher=Cult of Mac|accessdate=13 October 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; More cities would receive Flyover in later years, with [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] often adding multiple cities to Flyover at a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://9to5mac.com/2019/01/08/apple-maps-flyover-updated-locations/|title=New Flyover and indoor maps locations now available in Apple Maps|publisher=9to5Mac|accessdate=12 September 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.actualidadiphone.com/en/apple-adds-11-more-cities-to-flyover-on-its-maps/|title=Apple adds 11 more cities to Flyover on its maps|date=28 January 2015 |publisher=Actualidad iPhone|accessdate=12 September 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this initial release, Apple added the feature to other cities later in the year, including [[Toronto]] in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://urbantoronto.ca/news/2012/09/toronto-arrives-3d-apples-ios6.6393|title=Toronto Arrives in 3D in Apple's iOS6|publisher=Urban Toronto|accessdate=14 September 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Flyover was added to Paris, as well as smaller cities such as [[Indianapolis]] and [[Baltimore]], totalling 16 cities in the United States, Germany, Canada, France and the UK.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://9to5mac.com/2014/01/15/apple-expands-3d-flyover-coverage-in-maps-to-cape-town-and-helsinki/|title=Apple expands 3D Flyover coverage in Maps to Cape Town and Helsinki|publisher=9to5Mac|accessdate=12 September 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loopinsight.com/2013/03/12/apples-maps-being-updated-often-and-significantly/|title=Apple's Maps being updated often and significantly|publisher=The Loop|accessdate=12 September 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Flyover was also added to London, [[Barcelona]], [[Cologne]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://appleinsider.com/articles/13/03/13/apple-continues-rollout-of-flyover-support-3d-buildings-turn-by-turn-navigation-in-multiple-cities|title=Apple adds iOS Maps Flyover support, 3D buildings, turn-by-turn navigation in multiple cities|date=13 March 2013 |publisher=Apple Insider|accessdate=19 October 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rome, and [[Madrid]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gadgethelpline.com/apple-adds-flyover-3d-maps-15-cities-apple-maps/|title=Apple adds Flyover and 3D Maps to 15 new cities in Apple Maps|date=13 March 2013 |publisher=Gadget Helpline|accessdate=14 September 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the city of Vancouver, in Canada the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cultofmac.com/219490/apple-continues-to-bring-flyover-3d-buildings-to-more-cities-in-maps/|title=Apple Continues To Bring Flyover &amp; 3D Buildings To More Cities In Maps|date=13 March 2013 |publisher=Cult of Mac|accessdate=7 October 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2016–present===
2016 saw Apple add Flyover to around 20 additional cities, including cities such as [[Adelaide]] in Australia and the [[Virgin Islands]], with the majority of the new cities being smaller ones, as only two of the cities that received Flyover that year had over a million people.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Lovejoy|first=Ben|url=https://9to5mac.com/2016/02/04/apple-maps-flyover-locations/|title=Apple Maps adds 5 new U.S. Flyover locations, 15 more international ones|publisher=9to5Mac|accessdate=9 November 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2019 saw one of Apple's biggest Flyover expansions, with the feature being added to over 30 cities in France, Japan, the United States, and others, as well as the entirety of the nation of [[Monaco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.macrumors.com/2019/01/08/apple-maps-flyover-mall-locations/|title=Apple Maps Gains New Indoor Mall Maps and Flyover Locations|date=8 January 2019 |publisher=MacRumors|accessdate=12 September 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://9to5mac.com/2019/01/08/apple-maps-flyover-updated-locations/|title=New Flyover and indoor maps locations now available in Apple Maps|publisher=9to5mac|accessdate=6 November 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would remain the largest amount of new cities added in a single year until 2024, five years later.

After 2019 and during the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], relatively little progress was made with the feature, largely in favor of other newer features. However, Apple added some new Flyovers during and since then, expanding to [[Amsterdam]] in 2020&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/03/apple-maps-transit-3d-view-portugal-netherlands/|title=Apple Maps Expands Public Transit Information and 3D View in Portugal and the Netherlands|date=3 September 2020 |publisher=MacRumors|accessdate=12 September 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Neely|first=Amber|url=https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/09/03/apple-maps-now-has-3d-images-in-amsterdam-transit-information-in-portugal|title=Apple Maps now has 3D images in Amsterdam, transit information in Portugal|date=3 September 2020 |publisher=Apple Insider|accessdate=6 November 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vienna]] in 2023.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oe24.at/oesterreich/chronik/wien-bald-in-3d-apple-maps-vermisst-hauptstadt/520804076|title=Wien bald in 3D: Apple Maps vermisst Hauptstadt (in German)|date=June 2022 |publisher=oe24|accessdate=12 September 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major rollout of Flyover occurred in 2024, with dozens of cities across North America, Australia, and Europe receiving the feature, including [[Washington D.C.]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unilad.com/technology/news/apple-maps-google-maps-comparison-464100-20240821|last=Roberts|first=Kit|title=People notice major difference in Google Maps and Apple Maps but are divided on which is better|publisher=Unilad|accessdate=6 May 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kansas City]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Popa|first=Bogdan|url=https://www.autoevolution.com/news/apple-maps-flyover-quietly-launches-in-new-regions-233196.html|title=Apple Maps Flyover Quietly Launches in New Regions|date=30 April 2024 |publisher=autoevolution|accessdate=3 June 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Brisbane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Brookes|first=Tim|url=https://www.yahoo.com/tech/why-switched-google-maps-apple-130014614.html|title=Why I switched from Google Maps to Apple Maps|publisher=Yahoo Tech|accessdate=25 November 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; These updates continued into 2025, with [[Lisbon]], [[Frankfurt]], and several other cities receiving Flyover.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.heise.de/en/news/3D-flyover-Apple-Maps-adds-new-flyover-images-in-Germany-10249550.html|title=3D flyover: Apple Maps adds new flyover images in Germany|publisher=Heise|accessdate=16 February 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use ==
Apple collects the 3D data used for Flyover by using small military-grade&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Orange|first=Richard|url=https://www.thelocal.no/20130812/oslo-bans-apples-mapping-drones|title=Oslo bans Apple's mapping drones|publisher=The Local|accessdate=12 November 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]]-like planes, which fly up close to buildings to create a more detailed map. As of 2013, [[C3 Technologies]], a Swedish company which was acquired by Apple in 2011, has collected the data used for Flyover.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.applegazette.com/apple-inc/how-apple-creates-3d-flyover-maps/|title=How Apple Creates 3D Flyover Maps|publisher=Apple Gazette|accessdate=12 September 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Flyover, certain locations – mostly big cities, landmarks and some national parks – can be seen from a birds-eye perspective. The three-dimensional views are photo-realistic, and users can change the vantage point on the map.&lt;ref name="Maps"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Apple: Maps |url=https://www.apple.com/ios/maps/ |access-date=December 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flyover imagery has been viewed as similar to that of [[virtual reality]], and could possibly be a precursor to a VR feature on Maps.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Elliott|first=Matt|url=https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/take-awesome-vr-tours-with-apple-maps-flyover-feature/|title=Take awesome VR tours with Apple Map's Flyover feature|publisher=CNET|accessdate=18 November 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== City Tours ===
Flyover City Tours were released around 2014, but was inaccessible for a time until the feature was debugged by an Apple Maps developer, making it public.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; City Tours is a feature that allows users to view various landmarks in a given city via a "flying" animation,&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt; a feature only available to cities that already contain Flyover 3D maps.&lt;ref name="AppleToolBox"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://appletoolbox.com/what-is-the-flyover-feature-in-apple-maps/|title=What Is the Flyover Feature in Apple Maps?|date=29 March 2023 |publisher=AppleToolBox|accessdate=12 September 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; City Tours was added as a feature to Apple Maps on [[iOS 8]] on September 17, 2014, and in [[OS X Yosemite]] on October 16, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Slivka|first=Eric|url=https://www.macrumors.com/2014/09/07/flyover-city-tours/|title=Apple Filling Out Flyover City Tours Ahead of iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite Launches|date=7 September 2014 |publisher=MacRumors|accessdate=17 November 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most, but not all cities with Flyover allow tours of a given city, where the above virtual tour of various landmarks in the area will be shown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/take-flyover-tours-iph81a3f978/ios|title=Take Flyover tours in Maps on iPhone|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=12 September 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AppleToolBox"/&gt;

== Controversy ==
===Errors===
Similar to Maps itself, Flyover saw many visual issues upon release, a notable one containing a massive glitch on the [[Brooklyn Bridge|Brooklyn]] and [[Anzac Bridge|Anzac]] bridges in New York and Sydney, showing "plunges" on both structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2012/09/27/apple-maps-six-most-epic-fails/|title=Apple Maps' Six Most Epic Fails|work=Forbes|accessdate=19 October 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was part of a larger series of technical issues with Apple Maps, most of which have since been fixed.

===Security concerns===

In 2013, the Norwegian government denied a request by Apple to add Flyover to [[Oslo]], the Norwegian capital, citing security concerns arising from the amount of detail given to buildings, information which could potentially be used to facilitate and carry out terrorist attacks.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Dewey|first=Caitlin|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2013/08/13/why-norway-is-blocking-apple-maps-from-taking-3d-images-of-oslo/|title=Why Norway is blocking Apple Maps from taking 3D images of Oslo|newspaper=The Washington Post|accessdate=12 September 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto7"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Gates|first=Sara|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/norway-blocks-apple-3d-mapping-flyover-oslo_n_3743600|title=

Similar security concerns may have also prevented Apple from adding Flyover to other potentially sensitive areas, including [[Washington D.C.]] (which eventually got the feature in May 2024), among others.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The term is often used in discussions of [[computer science]] and [[Fairness (machine learning)|algorithmic fairness]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation |last=Chowdhury |first=Rumman |title=Moral Outsourcing: Humanity in the age of AI |date=2018-06-08 |url=https://www.ted.com/talks/rumman_chowdhury_moral_outsourcing_humanity_in_the_age_of_ai |access-date=2023-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it can apply to any situation in which one appeals to outside agents in order to absolve themselves of responsibility for their actions. In this context, moral outsourcing specifically refers to the tendency of society to blame technology, rather than its creators or users, for any harm it may cause.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news |date=2023-05-29 |title='I do not think ethical surveillance can exist': Rumman Chowdhury on accountability in AI |language=en-GB |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/29/rumman-chowdhury-interview-artificial-intelligence-accountability |access-date=2023-10-14 |issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
The term "moral outsourcing" was first coined by Dr. [[Rumman Chowdhury]], a data scientist concerned with the overlap between [[artificial intelligence]] and social issues.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Chowdhury used the term to describe looming fears of a so-called “[[Fourth Industrial Revolution]]” following the rise of artificial intelligence.

Moral outsourcing is often applied by technologists to shrink away from their part in building offensive products. In her TED Talk, Chowdhury gives the example of a creator excusing their work by saying they were simply doing their job.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is a case of moral outsourcing and not taking ownership for the consequences of creation. 

When it comes to AI, moral outsourcing allows for creators to decide when the machine is human and when it is a computer - shifting the blame and responsibility of moral plights off of the technologists and onto the technology. Conversations around AI and bias and its impacts require accountability to bring change. It is difficult to address these biased systems if their creators use moral outsourcing to avoid taking any responsibility for the issue.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

One example of moral outsourcing is the anger that is directed at machines for “taking jobs away from humans” rather than companies for employing that technology and jeopardizing jobs in the first place.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

The term "moral outsourcing" refers to the concept of [[outsourcing]], or enlisting an external operation to complete specific work for another organization. In the case of moral outsourcing, the work of resolving moral dilemmas or making choices according to an ethical code is supposed to be conducted by another entity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
== Real-World Applications ==
In the medical field, AI is increasingly involved in decision-making processes about which patients to treat, and how to treat them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Shaikh |first=Sonia Jawaid |date=2020 |title=Artificial Intelligence and Resource Allocation in Health Care: The Process-Outcome Divide in Perspectives on Moral Decision-Making |url=https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2884/paper_122.pdf |journal=Symposium on AI for Social Good}}&lt;/ref&gt; The responsibility of the doctor to make informed decisions about what is best for their patients is outsourced to an algorithm. Sympathy is also noted to be an important part of medical practice; an aspect that artificial intelligence, glaringly, is missing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Farhud |first1=Dariush D. |last2=Zokaei |first2=Shaghayegh |date=2021-10-27 |title=Ethical Issues of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine and Healthcare |url=https://publish.kne-publishing.com/index.php/ijph/article/view/7600 |journal=Iranian Journal of Public Health |volume=50 |issue=11 |pages=i-v |doi=10.18502/ijph.v50i11.7600 |issn=2251-6093 |pmc=8826344 |pmid=35223619}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of moral outsourcing is a major concern in the medical community.  

Another field of technology in which moral outsourcing is frequently brought up is [[Self-driving car|autonomous vehicles]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web |date=2016-05-28 |title=How will driverless cars make life-or-death decisions? |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/how-will-driverless-cars-make-life-or-death-decisions |access-date=2023-11-28 |website=PBS NewsHour |language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo|California Polytechnic State University]] professor Keith Abney proposed an example scenario: "Suppose we have some [troublemaking] teenagers, and they see an autonomous vehicle, they drive right at it. They know the autonomous vehicle will swerve off the road and go off a cliff, but should it?"&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The decision of whether to sacrifice the autonomous vehicle (and any passengers inside) or the vehicle coming at it will be written into the algorithms defining the car's behavior. In the case of moral outsourcing, the responsibility of any damage caused by an accident may be attributed to the autonomous vehicle itself, rather than the creators who wrote protocol the vehicle will use to "decide" what to do.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Moral outsourcing is also used to delegate the consequences of [[predictive policing]] algorithms to technology, rather than the creators or the police. There are many ethical concerns with predictive policing due to the fact that it results in the over-policing of low income and minority communities. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=VCE |date=2022-02-17 |title=Pitfalls of Predictive Policing: An Ethical Analysis |url=https://vce.usc.edu/volume-5-issue-3/pitfalls-of-predictive-policing-an-ethical-analysis/ |access-date=2023-11-30 |website=Viterbi Conversations in Ethics |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of moral outsourcing, the positive feedback loop of sending disproportionate police forces into minority communities is attributed to the algorithm and the data being fed into this system--rather than the users and creators of the predictive policing technology.   

== Outside of Technology ==

=== Religion ===
Moral outsourcing is also commonly seen in appeals to [[religion]] to justify [[discrimination]] or harm. In his book ''What It Means to be Moral,'' sociologist [[Phil Zuckerman]] contradicts the popular religious notion that [[morality]] comes from God. Religion is oftentimes cited as a foundation for a moral stance without any tangible relation between the religious beliefs and personal stance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=McKay |first1=Ryan |last2=Whitehouse |first2=Harvey |date=March 2015 |title=Religion and morality. |journal=Psychological Bulletin |language=en |volume=141 |issue=2 |pages=447–473 |doi=10.1037/a0038455 |issn=1939-1455|doi-access=free |pmid=25528346 |pmc=4345965 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cases, religious individuals will "outsource" their personal beliefs and opinions by claiming that they are a result of their religious identification. This is seen where religion is cited as a factor for political beliefs,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Graham |first1=Jesse |last2=Haidt |first2=Jonathan |date=February 2010 |title=Beyond Beliefs: Religions Bind Individuals Into Moral Communities |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1088868309353415 |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review |language=en |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=140–150 |doi=10.1177/1088868309353415 |pmid=20089848 |s2cid=264630346 |issn=1088-8683|url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt; medical beliefs,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Pelčić |first1=Gordana |last2=Karačić |first2=Silvana |last3=Mikirtichan |first3=Galina L. |last4=Kubar |first4=Olga I. |last5=Leavitt |first5=Frank J. |last6=Cheng-tek Tai |first6=Michael |last7=Morishita |first7=Naoki |last8=Vuletić |first8=Suzana |last9=Tomašević |first9=Luka |date=October 2016 |title=Religious exception for vaccination or religious excuses for avoiding vaccination |journal=Croatian Medical Journal |volume=57 |issue=5 |pages=516–521 |doi=10.3325/cmj.2016.57.516 |issn=0353-9504 |pmc=5141457 |pmid=27815943}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in extreme cases an excuse for violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Gonçalves |first1=Juliane Piasseschi de Bernardin |last2=Lucchetti |first2=Giancarlo |last3=Maraldi |first3=Everton de Oliveira |last4=Fernandez |first4=Paulo Eduardo Lahoz |last5=Menezes |first5=Paulo Rossi |last6=Vallada |first6=Homero |date=2023 |title=The role of religiosity and spirituality in interpersonal violence: a systematic review and meta-analysis |url=https://www.bjp.org.br/details/2327/en-US/the-role-of-religiosity-and-spirituality-in-interpersonal-violence--a-systematic-review-and-meta-analysis |journal=Brazilian Journal of Psychiatry |volume=45 |issue=2 |pages=162–181 |doi=10.47626/1516-4446-2022-2832 |pmc=10154014 |pmid=36331229}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Manufacturing ===
Moral outsourcing can also be seen in the business world in terms of manufacturing goods and avoiding environmental responsibility. Some companies in the United States will move their production process to foreign countries with more relaxed environmental policies to avoid the pollution laws that exist in the US. A study by the [[Harvard Business Review]] found that "in countries with tight environmental regulation, companies have 29% lower domestic emissions on average. On the other hand, such a tightening in regulation results in 43% higher emissions abroad."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Ben-David |first1=Itzhak (Zahi) |last2=Kleimeier |first2=Stefanie |last3=Viehs |first3=Michael |date=2019-02-04 |title=Research: When Environmental Regulations Are Tighter at Home, Companies Emit More Abroad |work=Harvard Business Review |url=https://hbr.org/2019/02/research-when-environmental-regulations-are-tighter-at-home-companies-emit-more-abroad |access-date=2023-11-30 |issn=0017-8012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consequences of higher pollution rates are then attributed to the loose regulations in these countries, rather than on the companies themselves who purposefully moved into these areas to avoid strict pollution policy. 

== [[Rumman Chowdhury]] ==
Chowdhury has a prominent voice in the discussions about the intersection of ethics and AI. Her ideas have been included in The Atlantic,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Chowdhury |first=Rumman |date=2023-02-17 |title=I Watched Elon Musk Kill Twitter's Culture From the Inside |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/02/elon-musk-twitter-ethics-algorithm-biases/673110/ |access-date=2023-10-14 |website=The Atlantic |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forbes,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Chowdhury |first=Rumman |title=Moral Outsourcing: Finding the Humanity in Artificial Intelligence |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/rummanchowdhury/2017/10/13/moral-outsourcing-2/ |access-date=2023-10-14 |website=Forbes |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; MIT Technology Review,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=What is an "algorithm"?

Systems cause '''representational harm''' when they misrepresent a group of people in a negative manner. Representational harms include perpetuating harmful [[stereotype]]s about or minimizing the existence of a social group, such as a racial, ethnic, gender, or religious group.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite thesis |last=Blodgett |first=Su Lin |date=2021-04-06 |title=Sociolinguistically Driven Approaches for Just Natural Language Processing |url=https://scholarworks.umass.edu/dissertations_2/2092 |journal=Doctoral Dissertations |doi=10.7275/20410631}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Machine learning]] algorithms often commit representational harm when they learn patterns from data that have [[algorithmic bias]], and this has been shown to be the case with [[large language model]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Luo |first=Yiwei |last2=Gligorić |first2=Kristina |last3=Jurafsky |first3=Dan |date=2024-05-28 |title=Othering and Low Status Framing of Immigrant Cuisines in US Restaurant Reviews and Large Language Models |url=https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/31367 |journal=Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media |language=en |volume=18 |pages=985–998 |doi=10.1609/icwsm.v18i1.31367 |issn=2334-0770|arxiv=2307.07645 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While preventing representational harm in models is essential to prevent harmful biases, researchers often lack precise definitions of representational harm and conflate it with allocative harm, an unequal distribution of resources among social groups, which is more widely studied and easier to measure.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; However, recognition of representational harms is growing and preventing them has become an active research area. Researchers have recently developed methods to effectively quantify representational harm in algorithms, making progress on preventing this harm in the future.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Types ==
Three prominent types of representational harm include stereotyping, denigration, and misrecognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last1=Rusanen |first1=Anna-Mari |last2=Nurminen |first2=Jukka K. |title=Ethics of Ai |url=https://ethics-of-ai.mooc.fi/ |website=ethics-of-ai.mooc.fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; These subcategories present many dangers to individuals and groups.

Stereotypes are oversimplified and usually undesirable representations of a specific group of people, usually by race and gender. This often leads to the denial of educational, employment, housing, and other opportunities.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Shelby |first1=Renee |last2=Rismani |first2=Shalaleh |last3=Henne |first3=Kathryn |last4=Moon |first4=AJung |last5=Rostamzadeh |first5=Negar |last6=Nicholas |first6=Paul |last7=Yilla-Akbari |first7=N'Mah |last8=Gallegos |first8=Jess |last9=Smart |first9=Andrew |last10=Garcia |first10=Emilio |last11=Virk |first11=Gurleen |chapter=Sociotechnical Harms of Algorithmic Systems: Scoping a Taxonomy for Harm Reduction |date=2023-08-29 |title=Proceedings of the 2023 AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society |chapter-url=https://doi.org/10.1145/3600211.3604673 |series=AIES '23 |location=New York, NY, USA |publisher=Association for Computing Machinery |pages=723–741 |doi=10.1145/3600211.3604673 |isbn=979-8-4007-0231-0|s2cid=256697294 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[model minority]] stereotype of Asian Americans as highly intelligent and good at mathematics can be damaging professionally and academically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Trytten |first1=Deborah A. |last2=Lowe |first2=Anna Wong |last3=Walden |first3=Susan E. |date=January 2, 2013 |title="Asians are Good at Math.

Representational harm happens when the representation of details teams improves damaging [[stereotype]]s, developing [[social exclusion]] and [[prejudice]]. This experience is particularly noticeable in the depiction of marginalised groups, containing [[Person of color|people of color]], women, [[LGBTQ|LGBTQ+]] people, and people with handicaps. Media depictions of these groups generally stop working to catch their array and intricacy. Instead, they are typically reduced to one-dimensional caricatures, which ultimately continue social prejudices. These organised depictions contribute to the help of hazardous [[stereotype]]s and the marginalisation of these locations.

Denigration is the action of unfairly criticizing individuals. This frequently happens when the demeaning of social groups occurs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For example, when searching for "Black-sounding" names versus "white-sounding" ones, some retrieval systems bolster the false perception of criminality by displaying ads for bail-bonding businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Sweeney |first=Latanya |date=2013-03-01 |title=Discrimination in Online Ad Delivery: Google ads, black names and white names, racial discrimination, and click advertising |journal=Queue |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=10–29 |doi=10.1145/2460276.2460278 |s2cid=35894627 |issn=1542-7730|doi-access=free |arxiv=1301.6822 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A system may shift the representation of a group to be of lower [[social status]], often resulting in a disregard from society.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Research shows that hazardous depictions in the media can have substantial emotional and social impacts on both individuals and areas. [[Lawrence D. Bobo|Lawrence Bobo]] examined the issue of [[Ethnic stereotype]] in film, tv, and marketing. [[African Americans]] are commonly received duties specified by features such as "[[Violence|violent]] tendencies," "[[laziness]]," or being "merely for contentment features." While these representations might appear varied externally, they stay to boost underlying frameworks of white prominence and racial inequality.&lt;ref&gt;'''Bobo, Lawrence D.''' "Race, Sociopolitical Participation, and Black Empowerment." ''American Political Science Review'', vol. 90, no. 3, 1996, pp. 493-508. ''Cambridge University Press'', &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/abs/race-sociopolitical-participation-and-black-empowerment/09E117B5F7C747E746EB60A18448A364&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; As a circumstances, Black individuals are frequently represented as law offenders or in secondary roles, which adds to the support of [[Ethnic stereotype]] and [[Institutional racism]].

Misrecognition, or incorrect [[Recognition (sociology)|recognition]], can display in many forms, including, but not limited to, erasing and alienating social groups, and denying people the right to self-identify.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Erasing and alienating social groups involves the unequal visibility of certain social groups; specifically, systematic ineligibility in algorithmic systems perpetuates inequality by contributing to the underrepresentation of social groups.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Not allowing people to self-identify is closely related as people's identities can be 'erased' or 'alienated' in these algorithms. Misrecognition causes more than surface-level harm to individuals: [[Psychological trauma|psychological harm]], [[social isolation]], and [[Emotional security|emotional insecurity]] can emerge from this subcategory of representational harm.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Quantification ==
As the dangers of representational harm have become better understood, some researchers have developed methods to measure representational harm in algorithms.

Modeling stereotyping is one way to identify representational harm. Representational stereotyping can be quantified by comparing the predicted outcomes for one social group with the ground-truth outcomes for that group observed in real data.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite arXiv |last1=Abbasi |first1=Mohsen |last2=Friedler |first2=Sorelle |last3=Scheidegger |first3=Carlos |last4=Venkatasubramanian |first4=Suresh |date=28 January 2019 |title=Fairness in representation: quantifying stereotyping as representational harm |class=cs.LG |eprint=1901.09565 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if individuals from group A achieve an outcome with a probability of 60%, stereotyping would be observed if it predicted individuals to achieve that outcome with a probability greater than 60%.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The group modeled stereotyping in the context of [[Classification in machine learning|classification]], [[Regression analysis|regression]], and [[Cluster analysis|clustering]] problems, and developed a set of rules to quantitatively determine if the model predictions exhibit stereotyping in each of these cases.{{Citation needed|date=December 2023}}

Other attempts to measure representational harms have focused on applications of algorithms in specific domains such as [[image captioning]], the act of an algorithm generating a short description of an image. In a study on image captioning, researchers measured five types of representational harm. To quantify stereotyping, they measured the number of incorrect words included in the model-generated image caption when compared to a [[Gold standard (test)|gold-standard]] caption.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Wang |first1=Angelina |last2=Barocas |first2=Solon |last3=Laird |first3=Kristen |last4=Wallach |first4=Hanna |chapter=Measuring Representational Harms in Image Captioning |date=2022-06-20 |title=2022 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency |chapter-url=https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3531146.3533099 |series=FAccT '22 |location=New York, NY, USA |publisher=Association for Computing Machinery |pages=324–335 |doi=10.1145/3531146.3533099 |isbn=978-1-4503-9352-2|s2cid=249674329 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They manually reviewed each of the incorrectly included words, determining whether the incorrect word reflected a stereotype associated with the image or whether it was an unrelated error, which allowed them to have a [[proxy measure]] of the amount of stereotyping occurring in this caption generation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These researchers also attempted to measure demeaning representational harm. To measure this, they analyzed the frequency with which humans in the image were mentioned in the generated caption. It was hypothesized that if the individuals were not mentioned in the caption, then this was a form of [[dehumanization]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Examples ==
One of the most notorious examples of representational harm was committed by [[Google]] in 2015 when an algorithm in Google Photos classified Black people as gorillas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=2015-07-01 |title=Google apologises for Photos app's racist blunder |language=en-GB |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-33347866 |access-date=2023-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developers at Google said that the problem was caused because there were not enough faces of Black people in the training dataset for the algorithm to learn the difference between Black people and gorillas.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Grant |first1=Nico |last2=Hill |date=May 22, 2023 |title=Google's Photo App Still Can't Find Gorillas. And Neither Can Apple's. |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/22/technology/ai-photo-labels-google-apple.html |access-date=December 5, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google issued an apology and fixed the issue by blocking its algorithms from classifying anything as a primate.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In 2023, Google's photos algorithm was still blocked from identifying gorillas in photos.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Another prevalent example of representational harm is the possibility of stereotypes being encoded in [[word embedding]]s, which are trained using a wide range of text. These word embeddings are the representation of a word as an [[Array (data structure)|array of numbers]] in [[vector space]], which allows an individual to calculate the relationships and similarities between words.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Major |first1=Vincent |last2=Surkis |first2=Alisa |last3=Aphinyanaphongs |first3=Yindalon |date=2018 |title=Utility of General and Specific Word Embeddings for Classifying Translational Stages of Research |journal=AMIA ... Annual Symposium Proceedings. AMIA Symposium |volume=2018 |pages=1405–1414 |issn=1942-597X |pmc=6371342 |pmid=30815185}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, recent studies have shown that these word embeddings may commonly encode harmful stereotypes, such as the common example that the phrase "[[Programmer|computer programmer]]" is oftentimes more closely related to "man" than it is to "women" in vector space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arXiv |last1=Bolukbasi |first1=Tolga |last2=Chang |first2=Kai-Wei |last3=Zou |first3=James |last4=Saligrama |first4=Venkatesh |last5=Kalai |first5=Adam |date=21 Jul 2016 |title=Man is to Computer Programmer as Woman is to Homemaker? Debiasing Word Embeddings |class=cs.CL |eprint=1607.06520 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This could be interpreted as a [[misrepresentation]] of computer programming as a profession that is better performed by men, which would be an example of representational harm.

== Addressing representational harm ==
Initiatives to minimise representational harm include advertising for even more inclusive and accurate portrayals of marginalised teams in the media. Scholars and protestors recommend that the method to reducing representational injury depends on raising the selection of voices both behind and before the digital video camera. When marginalized groups are provided the chance to represent themselves, they can check traditional stereotypes and present their experiences additional authentically.

Over the last few years, efforts to increase representation of people of color, women, and LGBTQ+ people in conventional media have made some progression. Films such as [[Selma (film)|Selma]], routed by [[Ava DuVernay]], and tv serise like [[Pose (TV series)|Pose]], developed by [[Ryan Murphy (producer)|Ryan Murphy]], have actually been extensively applauded for their nuanced and respectful representations of marginalised communities. These tasks existing complex individualities and stories that move past streamlined stereotypes.

Self-representation is one more crucial method to addressing representational harm. By equipping marginalised locations to create their really own tales, media designers can effectively reduce the perpetuation of hazardous stereotypes. This procedure consists of both the manufacturing of media product by participants of these communities and proactively difficult typical media structures that have actually historically omitted them.

The '''Motograph News Bulletin''', also known as the '''Zipper''', was a 380-feet-long [[Electromechanics|electromechanical]] [[news ticker]] display that wrapped around [[One Times Square]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Long |first=Tony |title=Nov. 6, 1928: All the News That's Lit |language=en-US |magazine=Wired |url=https://www.wired.com/2008/11/nov-6-1928-all-the-news-thats-lit/ |access-date=2023-12-08 |issn=1059-1028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Development and installation ===
Frank C. Reilly and Francis EJ Wilde, both engineers at ''Motogram,'' developed the technology used in the display.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Cressman |first=Dale |url=https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3114&amp;context=facpub |title=News in Lights: The Times Square Zipper and Newspaper Signs in an Age of Technological Enthusiasm |publisher=All Faculty Publication |year=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; While similar illuminated displays existed at the time, they all had disadvantages. Wilde patented many devices which helped overcome these shortcomings.&lt;ref&gt;''Electric Sign'', American patent ref. &lt;code&gt;US1626899A&lt;/code&gt;, registered on September 23, 1925 and applied on May 3, 1927; ''Electric-Sign Control'' American patent ref. &lt;code&gt;US1626900A&lt;/code&gt;, registered on March 24, 1926 and applied on May 3, 1927&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1926, Reilly proposed the idea of installing a news ticker bulletin on the Times Tower to the owner of the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' [[Adolph Ochs]] and deputy [[Arthur Hays Sulzberger]]. They all signed a contract July 26, 1928.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

It took 8 weeks to install the display with work being done 24 hours a day in order to meet the contracted deadline. The ''Times'' wanted to pay a maximum of $50,000 but due to the fact it was unique and custom manufactured along with several difficulties unforeseen during the installation process, ''Motogram'' ended up paying $80,000 for it. This led to increased animosity between the two companies.

The first headline displayed was the announcement of [[Herbert Hoover]]'s victory over [[Al Smith]] on November 6, 1928. The display read: ''HOOVER DEFEATS AL SMITH.''

The New York Times wrote and published an article, titled ''HUGE TIMES SIGN WILL FLASH NEWS,'' describing the device.

=== Subsequent history ===
The Motograph quickly became an icon of New York City. It appeared in many films of the time.

On May 18, 1942, it was extinguished for the first time in history in order to comply with the black-out orders given by the military.&lt;ref&gt;At the time, German submariners took advantage of the artificial lighting of large cities on the east coast of the United States to visually detect ships along the coast and torpedo them.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the morning of August 14, 1945 at 07:30 (EST), the following message was displayed on the Motograph: ''***OFFICIAL - TRUMAN ANNOUNCES JAPANESE SURRENDER***.'' James Torpey, the person responsible for composing the headlines and general operation, had spent nearly a day in order to make sure the headline was correct. He came up with the idea of adding 3 stars to the beginning and end of the headline which represented the 3 branches of the American armed forces. Almost 750,000 people crowded around the building to read the headline, the largest audience the Motograph would ever see likely due to the proliferation of television.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Lawrence Van Gelder, ''Lights Out for Times Square News Signs?'', article from the ''New York Times'', December 11, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

The Motograph operated continuously until 1961, when the ''Times'' moved out of the building. The tower was subsequently purchased by [[Allied Chemical]] in 1963. The display was put back into service in 1965 but would only operate sporadically, with some gaps lasting several years.

In 1975, the Motograph was extinguished. ''[[Newsday]]'' rented the display in 1980, putting it back into service once more. However, in December 1994, ''Newsday'' announced the lease would terminate at the end of the month citing profitability with Chiara Coletti commenting "Frankly, there's not that much bang for the buck."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Replacement ===
The Motograph was eventually replaced by a new display in 1997, utilizing 227,200 amber LEDs. The headlines are currently sourced from ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''.

== Technical aspects ==

=== Exterior display ===
The display wrapped around the 3rd floor of the building. It was made up of 14,800 incandescent bulbs distributed in a rectangular frame {{convert|368|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} long and {{convert|5|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} tall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/14/insider/platform-agnostic-for-nearly-100-years.html |title=In Times Past: Platform Agnostic for Nearly 100 Years |last=Dunlap |first=David W. |date=14 May 2023 |website=The New York Times |access-date=28 October 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the letters displayed consisted of a matrix 12 bulbs vertically and 7 bulbs horizontally. All of these bulbs were connected by vast amount of wiring to the device which allowed the letters to be displayed.&lt;ref&gt;Joe McKendry, ''One Times Square: A Century of Change at the Crossroads of the World'', 2012, David R. Godine editions, ( {{ISBN|978-1-56792-364-3}} )&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Composition of headlines ===
In order to compose a headline, an operator would place thin metal plates {{convert|19|by|7.6|cm|in|abbr=on}} with the letters making up the headlines in relief onto a frame. The frame would move along a conveyor belt to a field of brushes each connected to individual lightbulbs. This would cause the lightbulbs to flash in a manner making up the individual letters, thus displaying the headline.

'''Brilliant Labs''' is a [[Singapore]]-based technology company that produces open source eyewear featuring artificial intelligence (AI).

Brilliant Labs was founded in 2019 in Hong Kong by Bobak Tavangar, a former [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] program lead. Tavangar said he saw the potential for integrating the capabilities of [[artificial intelligence]] into glasses to give consumers "visual superpowers." The goal was to use an [[open source]] platform for development that would allow for creators to access the company's code and create new [[App store|apps]] for devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Lee |first=Zinnia |title=Meet The Tiny Startup Aiming To Take On Apple And Meta With AI-Powered Smart Glasses |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/zinnialee/2024/01/15/meet-the-tiny-startup-aiming-to-take-on-apple-and-meta-with-ai-powered-smart-glasses/ |access-date=2024-02-09 |website=Forbes |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2024, the company introduced its first product, Frame{{citation needed|date=December 2024}}, which were glasses that looked similar to those worn by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] co-founder [[Steve Jobs]]. They were designed to be indistinguishable from regular eyeglasses and would be worn by those who wore prescription lenses. The glasses were enabled for audio with a voice assistant called Noa and featured an AI search engine called [[Perplexity.ai|Perplexity]]. They came at a time when other companies introduced similar products, like [[Humane Inc.|AI Pin from Humane]], [[Rabbit r1|R1 from Rabbit]], or [[Vision Pro]] from [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], and came after other products, like [[Google Glass]] or [[HoloLens]] from [[Microsoft]] did not gain traction. Prior to this, the company offered the Monocle, an [[Augmented reality|augmented reality (AR)]] lens that attached to traditional glasses, and which also used open source software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Staff |first=V.

Closed-loop geothermal systems are one of the prominent categories of next-generation geothermal systems in development today.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Next-Generation Geothermal Power |url=https://liftoff.energy.gov/next-generation-geothermal-power/ |access-date=2024-03-30 |website=Pathways to Commercial Liftoff |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=DOE Unveils Roadmap for the Next Generation of Geothermal Power |url=https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-unveils-roadmap-next-generation-geothermal-power |access-date=2024-03-30 |website=Energy.gov |date=18 March 2024 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Geothermal technology overview.png|thumb|''Geothermal technology overview across conventional (left) and next-generation (right) designs.''&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;]]
Like all geothermal systems, closed-loop geothermal systems provide [[renewable energy]], and primarily operate as baseload resources that produce energy at a constant rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=5 Things to Know About Geothermal Power |url=https://www.energy.gov/eere/articles/5-things-know-about-geothermal-power |access-date=2024-03-30 |website=Energy.gov |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike conventional [[geothermal energy]] plants, closed-loop geothermal plants can be placed anywhere in the world, depending only on the depth of the hot rock resource.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Closed-loop geothermal projects are under development in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Japan]], and [[Germany]].

== Technology ==
[[File:ClosedLoopGeothermal.png|thumb|Illustration of two basic setups for closed-loop geothermal systems, the U-tube (left), and the tube-in-tube (right).&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web |title=New tool models viability of closed-loop geothermal systems |url=https://newsreleases.sandia.gov/geothermal_modeling/ |access-date=2024-04-18 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Closed-loop geothermal companies use a wide variety of engineered systems to produce geothermal energy. These systems primarily vary based on the length and geometry of the closed-loop wells placed subsurface, but can also vary in the materials used in well construction and the working fluid used.

Two commons designs of closed-loop geothermal systems are the U-tube and the tube-in-tube:&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

* '''U-tube closed-loop geothermal:''' In this system, cool water is pumped down one deep vertical pipe, which then extends horizontally for a certain distance at a depth where the rock is hot and then comes up in a different location. The horizontal section may be composed of one or multiple lateral (horizontal) well sections. 
* '''Tube-in-a-tube closed-loop geothermal:''' In this system, the cool water is pumped down along the outer layer of a pipe to a certain depth, at which point the pipe may extend an additional horizontal distance at that depth. When the hot water hits the end of the pipe it is pushed into the inner pipe, through which the hot water returns to the surface. Also called a coaxial or pipe-in-pipe system.

== Research and development ==
Several closed-loop geothermal systems have been demonstrated globally. One commercial closed-loop geothermal project is under construction in Geretsried, Germany.

== Advantages ==
The advantages of a deep, closed-loop geothermal circuit include&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Roberts |first=David |date=2020-10-21 |title=Geothermal energy is poised for a big breakout |url=https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2020/10/21/21515461/renewable-energy-geothermal-egs-ags-supercritical |access-date=2024-03-30 |website=Vox |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=New Opportunities and Applications for Closed-Loop Geothermal Energy Systems {{!}} Geothermal Rising :: Using the Earth to Save the Earth |url=https://geothermal.org/our-impact/blog/new-opportunities-and-applications-closed-loop-geothermal-energy-systems |access-date=2024-03-31 |website=geothermal.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# No need for a geofluid
# No need for the hot rock to be permeable or porous
# All the introduced working fluid can be recirculated with zero loss
# No [[fracking]] or stimulation is required to establish the engineered geothermal reservoir.

These advantages mean closed-loop geothermal systems can be placed anywhere in the world as a source of [[Carbon-free and nuclear-free energy|carbon-free]], baseload energy, with no impact to natural water resources and significantly reduced risk of [[induced seismicity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Geothermal Anywhere |url=https://www.nrel.gov/geothermal/anywhere.html |access-date=2024-03-30 |website=www.nrel.gov |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related terminology ==

=== Hot dry rock ===

Hot dry rock (HDR) is an abundant source of [[geothermal energy]], but it is typically difficult to access. Hot, dry crystalline [[Basement (geology)|basement]] rocks are found almost everywhere sufficiently far beneath the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=November 2022 |title=Superhot Rock Energy: A Vision for Firm, Global Zero-Carbon Energy |url=https://www.catf.us/resource/superhot-rock-energy-a-vision-for-firm-global-zero-carbon-energy/ |journal=Clean Air Task Force}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:CATF_superhot_rock_energy_project_map.jpg|thumb|Map of current and planned superhot rock energy projects]]
Multiple deep hot dry rock wells have been drilled around the world, including the US, Japan, Australia, France, and the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ball |first1=Philip |title=Superhot Rock Project Map |url=https://www.catf.us/shrmap/ |website=Clean Air Task Force}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas hydrothermal energy production can exploit already present hot fluids, HDR recovers heat from dry rock via the circulation of an artificially introduced working fluid. Ongoing efforts are underway to further develop and test technologies that can produce [[geothermal energy]] from hot dry rock, including [[Enhanced geothermal system|Enhanced Geothermal Systems]] and Closed-Loop Geothermal Systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Adler |first1=Ben |date=11 January 2023 |title=Geothermal energy poised for boom, as U.S. looks to follow Iceland's lead |url=https://news.yahoo.com/geothermal-energy-poised-for-boom-as-us-looks-to-follow-icelands-lead-100022399.html |access-date=18 January 2023 |website=Yahoo News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Closed-loop geothermal systems vs. ground source heat pumps ===
Closed-loop geothermal systems are not to be confused with the [[ground source heat pump]]s used for small-scale, largely residential heating and cooling. While both systems use underground closed-loop circuits of working fluid, there are important differences in the depth, temperature, scale, and applications for each system:

* '''Depth:''' Ground source heat pumps are placed at shallow depths, less than 400 feet (122 meters).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Geothermal Heat Pumps |url=https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/geothermal-heat-pumps |access-date=2024-04-13 |website=Energy.gov |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Closed-loop geothermal systems are drilled much deeper, greater than 1640 feet (500 meters), to access the hotter rock found at greater depths (see: [[geothermal gradient]]).
* '''Temperature:''' Ground source heat pumps target shallow ground temperatures, which vary seasonally from 45&amp;nbsp;°F (7&amp;nbsp;°C) to 75&amp;nbsp;°F (21&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Closed-loop geothermal systems target much hotter underground temperatures, greater than 212&amp;nbsp;°F (100&amp;nbsp;°C), to produce larger volumes of energy.
* '''Scale:''' Ground source heat pumps are used for small-scale residential heating and cooling and  typically produce less than 1 kilowatt of thermal energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Energy |first=Dandelion |date=2020-02-10 |title=Do Geothermal Heat Pumps Raise Your Electric Bill? - Dandelion Energy |url=https://dandelionenergy.com/geothermal-heat-pump-electricity-usage |access-date=2024-04-14 |website=Dandelion Energy {{!}} Energy Efficiency in Home Heating |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Closed-Loop Geothermal Systems are used for utility-scale commercial and industrial energy production and typically produce greater than 1 megawatt of thermal energy.
* '''Application:''' Ground source heat pumps are most often used for small-scale residential and commercial buildings, and are only used for heating and cooling applications.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Closed-loop geothermal systems are most suitable for large-scale commercial and industrial use, and can be used for electricity production, in addition to 'direct use' heating and cooling.

that the [[Labour Party (UK)| Labour]] government will introduce the Cyber Security and Resilience Bill (CS&amp;R).&lt;ref name=CSRB_1&gt;{{cite news| title=Key points in King's Speech at a glance| author=Seddon, P.| url=https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c51y7pqy1v3o| date=15 July 2024| publisher=[[BBC News]]| access-date=30 July 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed legislation is intended to update the existing Network and Information Security Regulations 2018, known as UK NIS.&lt;ref name=CSPM_1&gt;{{cite web| title=King's Speech: new cyber resilience laws planned in the UK| url=https://www.pinsentmasons.com/out-law/news/king-speech-uk-nis2-trailed-cyber-resilience-law-announced| publisher=Pinsent Masons| date=17 July 2024| access-date=5 August 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; CS&amp;R will strengthen the UK's [[Proactive cyber defence| cyber defences]] and [[Cyber resilience| resilience]] to hostile attacks thus ensuring that the infrastructure and critical services relied upon by [[United Kingdom| UK]] companies are protected by addressing [[Vulnerability (computer security)| vulnerabilities]], while ensuring the [[digital economy]] can deliver [[Economic growth| growth]].&lt;ref name=CSRB_7&gt;{{cite web| title=The King's Speech 2024| url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6697f5c10808eaf43b50d18e/The_King_s_Speech_2024_background_briefing_notes.pdf| publisher=UK GOV| page=94| access-date=30 July 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legislation will expand the remit of the existing regulations and put regulators on a stronger footing, as well as increasing the reporting requirements placed on businesses to help build a better picture of cyber threats.&lt;ref name=CSRB_2&gt;{{cite news| title=Labour announces host of new tech rules – but does not reveal much-hyped 'AI bill'| author=Griffin, A.| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/tech/labour-kings-speech-ai-bill-new-tech-b2581383.html| publisher=[[The Independent|Independent]]| date=17 July 2024| access-date=30 July 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its aim is to strengthen UK cyber defences, ensuring that the critical [[infrastructure]] and digital services which companies rely on are secure.&lt;ref name=CSRB_3&gt;{{cite web| title=Government announces new Bill to strengthen the UK's cyber security and resilience| author1=Patefield, D.| author2=Broom, J.| author3=Collings, A.| author4=Tsolova, R.| author5=Modha, T.| url=https://www.techuk.org/resource/government-announces-new-bill-to-strengthen-the-uk-s-cyber-security-and-resilience.html| publisher=techUK| date=19 July 2024| access-date=30 July 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bill will extend and apply UK-wide.&lt;ref name=CSRB_7/&gt;

== Key facts ==

The key facts from the King's Speech are:&lt;ref name=CSRB_7/&gt;
{{blockquote| '''i''') The current UK NIS cyber security regulations play an essential role in safeguarding the UK’s critical national infrastructure by placing security duties on industry involved in the delivery of essential services.&lt;ref name=NIS_1&gt;{{cite web| title=The Network and Information Systems Regulations 2018| url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/506/made| publisher=[[Crown copyright| Crown]]| date=10 May 2024| access-date=4 August 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; These regulations cover the five sectors of transport, energy, [[drinking water]], health and digital infrastructure, as well as some digital services including [[online marketplace]]s, online search engines, and cloud computing services. 12 regulators are responsible for implementing the present regulations.

'''ii)''' Hostile cyber actors are increasingly targeting UK critical sectors and supply chains. Recent serious high-profile attacks impacting London hospitals and the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)| Ministry of Defence]], as well as [[ransomware]] attacks on the [[British Library]] and [[Royal Mail]], have highlighted that UK services and institutions are vulnerable to attack.

'''iii)''' The impacts of a cyber attack on these sectors pose severe risks to UK citizens, core services and the economy at large. For example, as a result of the ransomware attack affecting the [[NHS]] in England in June [2024], 3,396 outpatient appointments and 1,255 elective procedures were postponed across [[King's College Hospital]], [[Guy’s Hospital]] and [[St Thomas’ Hospital]], all in South London. It has been estimated that the cost of cybercrime in the UK in 2023 was $320 billion, near £225 billion.&lt;ref name=SCS_1&gt;{{cite web| title=Annual cost of cybercrime in the UK 2017-2028| url=https://www.statista.com/forecasts/1425776/uk-cybercrime-cost-annual| publisher=Ani Petrosyan| date=1 December 2023| access-date=7 August 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''iv)''' The [[National Cyber Security Centre (United Kingdom)| National Cyber Security Centre]] (NCSC) assess that the increased threat from [[Cyberwarfare| hostile states]] and state-sponsored actors continues to escalate. At a recent speech at CyberUK, NCSC [[Chief executive officer| CEO]] Felicity Oswald warned that providers of essential services in the UK cannot afford to ignore these threats.&lt;ref name=CBUK_1&gt;{{cite web| title=CYBERUK 2024: Felicity Oswald keynote speech| url=https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/speech/cyberuk-2024-ncsc-ceo-keynote-speech| publisher=[[National Cyber Security Centre (United Kingdom)|National Cyber Security Centre]]| date=May 2024| access-date=15 August 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''v)''' 2 UK NIS Post-Implementation Reviews found that the original regulations are having a positive impact, but that progress has not been fast enough.&lt;ref name="RNIS_1"&gt;{{cite web| title=Review of the Network and Information Systems Regulations| url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/review-of-the-network-and-information-systems-regulations| publisher=[[Crown copyright| Crown]]| date=29 May 2020| access-date=2 November 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SPIR_1"&gt;{{cite web| title=Second Post-Implementation Review of the Network and Information Systems Regulations 2018| url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/second-post-implementation-review-of-the-network-and-information-systems-regulations-2018/second-post-implementation-review-of-the-network-and-information-systems-regulations-2018| publisher=[[Crown copyright| Crown]]| date=27 July 2022| access-date=15 August 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2022 the review found that they "are a vital framework in raising wider UK resilience against network and information systems security threats", but updates are required to keep pace with growing threats. Just over half of the operators of essential services have updated or strengthened existing policies and processes since the inception of the UK NIS Regulations in 2018, which were introduced after [[EU]] NIS Directive 2016/1148.&lt;ref name=CSPM_1/&gt;&lt;ref name=EU_NIS1&gt;{{cite web| title=Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council| url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/eudr/2016/1148/contents| publisher=[[Crown copyright| Crown]]| date=6 July 2016| access-date=22 August 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Consequences ==

It will introduce compulsory ransomware reporting so that the authorities can better understand the threat and "alert us to potential attacks by expanding the type and nature of incidents that regulated entities must report."&lt;ref name=CSRB_4/&gt;&lt;ref name=CSIM_1&gt;{{cite web| title=UK Government Set to Introduce New Cyber Security and Resilience Bill| author=Muncaster, P.| url=https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/government-cyber-security-bill-2024| publisher=Reed Exhibitions| date=18 July 2024| access-date=5 August 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this information collection is likely to increase resilience to attacks, the administrative burden for businesses from this reporting might well bring with it additional costs as well as the original cyber incident's expense.&lt;ref name=CSRB_4/&gt;

As modern business practices are interconnected, organisations must ensure that their partners and suppliers 
also adhere to the standards set by the CS&amp;R.&lt;ref name=CSRB_4/&gt;

In the EU, the original Network and Information Security Directive (NIS Directive 2016/1148) is being updated to Directive 2022/2555, known as EU NIS 2.&lt;ref name=TL_1&gt;{{cite web| title=New Cyber Security &amp; Resilience Bill announced in King's Speech| author=Belcheva, R.| url=https://thelens.slaughterandmay.com/post/102je92/new-cyber-security-and-resilience-bill-announced-in-kings-speech| website=The Lens| date=23 July 2024| access-date=13 August 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NIS-2&gt;{{cite web| title=The NIS 2 Directive| url=https://www.nis-2-directive.com| publisher=Cyber Risk| date=2022| access-date=13 August 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; EU NIS 2 introduces wide-reaching changes to the existing EU cyber security laws for network and information systems.&lt;ref name=TL_1/&gt; The CS&amp;R should bring the existing UK NIS regulations 2018 to a framework similar to that of the EU.&lt;ref name=TL_1/&gt;&lt;ref name="NRD_1"&gt;{{cite web| author=Poireault, K.| title=

The Bill as yet has no information on any punishments for non-compliance or what the data regulators' demands from an organisation that has experienced a cyber security incident will be.&lt;ref name=CSRB_8&gt;{{cite web| title=Revamped UK cybersecurity bill couldn't come soon enough, but details are patchy| author=Jones, C.| url=https://www.theregister.com/2024/07/30/uk_csr_bill_analysis| website=[[The Register]]| date=30 July 2024| access-date=4 August 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reaction ==

Jon Ellison, NCSC Director of National Resilience, said that the proposed bill was "a landmark moment tackling the growing threat to the UK's critical systems".&lt;ref name=NHI_1&gt;{{cite web| title=NCSC highlights importance of Cyber Security Bill| author=Say, M.| url=https://www.ukauthority.com/articles/ncsc-highlights-importance-of-cyber-security-bill| publisher=Informed Communications Ltd| date=25 July 2024| access-date=29 August 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued that it will be "a crucial step towards a more comprehensive regulatory regime, fit for our volatile world".&lt;ref name=NHI_1/&gt;

Former head of the NCSC Ciaran Martin along with other experts welcomed the legislative proposal. On social media, he wrote that the proposed legislation seemed sensible, with mandatory reporting requirements being significant and positive steps.&lt;ref name=UKL_1&gt;{{cite web| title=UK Labour Introduces Cyber Security and Resilience Bill| author=Akshaya, A.| url=https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/uk-labour-introduces-cyber-security-resilience-bill-a-25788| publisher=Information Security Media Group| date=17 July 2024| access-date=16 August 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A representative of the CyberUp Campaign Matt Hull said that the organisation is looking forward to the Government updating UK cyber resilience and in particular the [[Computer Misuse Act 1990]]. Any updates to this Act would help cyber professionals protect the U.K., safeguard the digital economy and unlock the potential growth within the cybersecurity industry.&lt;ref name=UKL_1/&gt;

== Cyber security and resilience policy statement ==

In April 2025, the CS&amp;R [[Government policy statement| Policy Statement]] was published, which outlines the confirmed and proposed measures to be included in the bill.&lt;ref name="GPP_1"&gt;{{cite press release| title=Cyber security and resilience policy statement| url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cyber-security-and-resilience-bill-policy-statement/cyber-security-and-resilience-bill-policy-statement#cyber-security-and-resilience-bill-measures| website=Department for Science, Innovation &amp; Technology| publisher=[[Crown copyright| Crown]]| date=1 April 2025| access-date=15 April 2025| isbn=978-1-5286-5588-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quoting: "The digital revolution is transforming our  [[Critical infrastructure| Critical National Infrastructure (CNI)]] and our essential public services. It offers an extraordinary opportunity – to make our people and our country better off. However, it may also bring new and dangerous vulnerabilities... In this Policy Statement, I set out legislative proposals for this Bill. I also acknowledge that the cyber landscape moves exponentially – a lot can happen in a short space of time. This statement proposes several additional measures to tackle the threats that we are facing now."&lt;ref name="GPP_1"/&gt;

The legislation aims to strengthen the UK's cyber defenses and secure critical infrastructure and essential digital services, thereby enhancing CNI protection.&lt;ref name="ICPS_1"&gt;{{cite web| last1=Ribeiro| first1=Anna| title=UK Cyber Security and Resilience Bill: Policy statement details confirmed and proposed measures for enhanced CNI protection| url=https://industrialcyber.co/regulation-standards-and-compliance/uk-cyber-security-and-resilience-bill-policy-statement-details-confirmed-and-proposed-measures-for-enhanced-cni-protection| website=Industrial Cyber| date=1 April 2025| access-date=15 April 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statement details plans to expand the regulatory framework to cover more entities, empower regulators and improve oversight. This includes enhancing incident reporting, augmenting the [[Information Commissioner’s Office| ICO's]] information-gathering capabilities and improving regulators’ cost recovery mechanisms. The bill also addresses the need for an adaptable regulatory framework to keep pace with the ever-evolving cyber landscape.&lt;ref name="ICPS_1"/&gt;

CS&amp;R seeks to broaden the scope of organizations required to improve their risk assessments, strengthening cybersecurity measures for approximately 1000 organizations. &lt;ref name="IMCR_1"&gt;{{cite magazine| last1=Muncaster| first1=Phil| title=Cyber Security and Resilience Bill Will Apply to 1000 UK Firms| url=https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/cyber-security-resilience-bill| website=Infosecurity magazine| publisher=[[RELX| Reed Exhibitions]]| date=1 April 2025| access-date=15 April 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; These measures will increase data protection and network security and are likely to include data center operators and [[Managed services| managed service providers]] . The proposals also include giving regulators more tools to enhance security standards, mandating detailed incident reporting and granting the government powers to update regulatory frameworks as threats and technology evolve.&lt;ref name="IMCR_1"/&gt;

The statement provides a detailed overview of the changes to the Cyber Essentials program, including updates to the software definition, vulnerability fixes and terminology related to remote working.&lt;ref name="TUK_1"&gt;{{cite web| title=Cyber Security and Resilience Bill - Policy Statement of Intent| url=https://www.techuk.org/resource/cyber-security-and-resilience-bill-policy-statement-of-intent.html| website=TechUK| date=1 April 2025| access-date=15 April 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cyber Essentials Plus test specification will be updated with new verification pointers, verification of segregation by sub-set and verification of sampling. The statement also outlines the steps organizations will need to take to achieve Cyber Essentials certification in 2025 and onwards. These include changes to IT infrastructure requirements, such as the introduction of [[Passwordless authentication| passwordless authentication]].&lt;ref name="TUK_1"/&gt;

A '''hot stab''' is a type of subsea connector specifically designed to be easily inserted and removed by a [[remotely operated underwater vehicle]] (ROV) [[manipulator arm]]. The hot stab is the connector which supplies remote utilities. It is normally inserted into a port after removing the plug stab, which is left in the port when the hot stab is disconnected, to keep the port clean and free of fouling when not in use. The alignment is generally not critical for insertion, and the stab is guided into the port by the port geometry, which tends to be concentric cylinder and cone sections, tapering down from the handle end to the tip, with a series of O-ring seals separating the ports or contacts spaced along the length. The stab may be locked into place or may require the ROV to hold it in place while it is in use.&lt;ref name="IADC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PMT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Secc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tekflow" /&gt;

==Purpose==
A hot stab provides a temporary pressure-tight connection between an external service and a [[subsea installation]], which can be used for a wide variety of applications.&lt;ref name="Secc" /&gt;

Some operations require low to medium flow rates for a short period to operate a mechanism from one position to another. These may be called static applications. Other operations need continuous medium or high flow rates.&lt;ref name="Secc" /&gt;

==Applications==

*Hydraulic – Used for hydraulic control fluids to operate valves, connectors, actuators, clamps, pumps and other systems.&lt;ref name="Secc" /&gt;
*Chemical injection.&lt;ref name="Secc" /&gt;
*Electrical power and communication connections.&lt;ref name="Secc" /&gt;
*Multifunction hot stabs combine two or more of these services in one connector unit.&lt;ref name="Secc" /&gt;
*Bell umbilical services may use a hot stab type connector for emergency services.&lt;ref name="D-BE 2015" /&gt;
*There are types defined by geometry and port specifications.&lt;ref name="Secc" /&gt;

==Components==

*The stab plate is a fixed position part on the subsea structure&lt;ref name="Secc" /&gt;
*The receptacle is the part on the structure into which the hot stab is inserted. It receives and secures the hot stab and contains the static set of ports or contacts.&lt;ref name="Secc" /&gt;
*The stab is the mobile component that is inserted into the receptacle by the ROV or diver. The stab which carries the services is the hot stab (or live stab),&lt;ref name="PMT" /&gt; and the plug stab is an unserviced component of the same basic geometry used to close the receptacle when not in use, to keep out detritus and prevent growth of marine fouling, and to keep water out of hydraulic systems.&lt;ref name="Secc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PMT" /&gt;
*The seals prevent leakage to the environment and between ports under high pressures. The seals may be pressure balanced to prevent separation forces.&lt;ref name="Secc" /&gt; 
*Alignment aids may include a guide nose, funnel, bucket, and latches, to facilitate precise alignment of the stab and receptacle.&lt;ref name="Secc" /&gt;
*The stab is connected to hoses and/or cables to supply fluids or electrical power or signals to the appropriate ports or contacts. of the receptacle.&lt;ref name="Secc" /&gt;
*The handle allows the ROV or diver to grip, manipulate and move the stab.&lt;ref name="Secc" /&gt;
*Non-return valves may be used in the stab or receptacle to prevent loss of fluids to the environment.&lt;ref name="Secc" /&gt;

The [[American Petroleum Institute]] (API) has published "API 17H recommended practice for subsea production systems", which provides specifications for standard types of hydraulic hot stabs with flow path bores ranging from {{convert|0.25 to 3.5|in|mm}}.&lt;ref name="PMT" /&gt;

==Terminology==
*The term "stab" is used for the insertable component (pin), the combination of pin and box (receptacle), and the action of inserting the pin into the receptacle.&lt;ref name="IADC" /&gt;
*"Hot stab" may refer to the insertable component with services, or to the technology in general.&lt;ref name="IADC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tekflow" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PMT" /&gt;
*"Live stab" or "live hot stab"refers to the insertable component with services.&lt;ref name="Secc" /&gt;
*"Plug stab", "dummy stab", "blind stab" or "parking stab" is the insertable component without services used for blanking off the receptacle.&lt;ref name="Secc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PMT" /&gt;
*The receptacle may also be called the "box".&lt;ref name="IADC" /&gt;

==Sizing== 
A hot stab can be specified by the inside diameter of the receptacle, the bore and number of the ports and the type of handle. API/ISO specifications identify stabs by type, size, and port geometry and are interchangeable if the API/ISO-type, size and port specification match.&lt;ref name="Secc" /&gt;

==Operation==
Removal of the plug stab (also known as the dummy or parking stab) from the receptacle is followed by insertion of the hot stab into the port. This operation can be done by a diver or a ROV with manipulator arm. The stab is not a self-locking mechanism, and though the internal forces may be balanced, an external force is required to secure the stab in place in the receptacle.&lt;ref name="IADC" /&gt;

==Standards==

*ISO 13624-1:2009, Petroleum and natural gas industries – Drilling and production equipment – Part 1:Design and operation of marine drilling riser equipment.&lt;ref name="IADC" /&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;'''&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''MarketSpaces by [https://drop-desk.com DropDesk]'''&lt;nowiki&gt;'''&lt;/nowiki&gt; (formerly Onboardly) is a technology platform that connects people by unlocking the potential of underutilized spaces.  It operates a two-sided marketplace connecting hosts with users seeking spaces for various activities.  

DropDesk facilitates: 

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;   **Productivity:** Connecting creators and businesses with suitable spaces, empowering them to work effectively.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;   **Space Utilization:** Enabling hosts to monetize unused spaces by simplifying listing, management, and marketing, including handling bookings and payments.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;   **Marketplace Development:** Providing tools for businesses and online directories to launch their own two-sided marketplaces, expanding access to local spaces and services.

== History ==
Onboardly started as a PR and Marketing Agency in July 2012 by Renée Warren and Heather Carson.&lt;ref name = forbes /&gt;&lt;ref name = itbusiness&gt;{{cite web | author = Howard Solomon | publisher = ITBusiness | title = Onboardly launches as 'a startup for startups' | date = 2012-10-07 | url = http://www.itbusiness.ca/news/onboardly-launches-as-a-startup-for-startups/18132 | accessdate = 2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before Onboardly, Warren was the CEO and co-founder of another [[digital marketing]] agency, Carson ran her own PR consultancy.&lt;ref name = marketingmagazine&gt;{{cite news | author = Russ Martin | title = It's Okay to have a Fear of Commitment | date = July 2012 | work = Marketing Magazine | volume = 117 | issue = 13 | page = 14A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warren and Carson came together to establish Onboardly in an effort to help small, and medium-sized companies, along with [[startup company|startups]].&lt;ref name = marketingmagazine/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Ken Hartos | publisher = Skilled Up | title = Learn How To Do PR in 2014 with Heather Carson of Onboardly | date = | url = http://www.skilledup.com/learn/marketing/learn-pr-2014-heather-carson-onboardly/ | accessdate = 2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smartphone Experts – later called Mobile Nations – launched ''Android Central'' in September 2008 under the guidance of [[Dieter Bohn]], later a founding editor of ''[[The Verge]]''. 

The first article published on the site was on 25 September, 2008, by Casey Chan, titled "T-Mobile G1 doesn't have a 3.5mm headphone jack."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Chan |first=Casey |date=25 September 2008 |title=T-Mobile G1 Doesn’t Have 3.5mm Headphone Jack |url=https://www.androidcentral.com/t-mobile-g1-doesnt-have-35mm-headphone-jack |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219000337/http://androidcentral.com/t-mobile-g1-doesnt-have-35mm-headphone-jack/ |archive-date=19 February 2009 |access-date=26 February 2025 |work=Android Central}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wikipedia in Papiamento''' is the [[Papiamento]] edition of the [[online encyclopedia]] [[Wikipedia]]. The Papiamento Wikipedia project has been official since [[March 26]], [[2006]]. As of July 6, 2020 there were about 1,981 articles on the website and more than 10,000 registered users (of which only 18 can be considered "active users").

== Orthography ==
There are two [[Orthography|orthographies]] of the Papiamento language that are officially recognized. The [[Aruba|Aruban]] orthography of Papiamento, based on etymological principles, uses the letters ''c'' and ''o'' more often, while the orthography used in [[Curaçao]] and [[Bonaire]] is based on phonological principles and uses the letters ''k'' and ''u'' more often. It also differs in use of accent. Wikipedia in Papiamento allows articles in both orthographies, provided that each article maintains consistency in the orthography it uses.

The '''history of science and technology''' ('''HST''') is a field of [[history]] that examines the development of the understanding of the natural world (science) and humans' ability to manipulate it ([[technology]]) at different points in time. This academic discipline also examines the cultural, economic, and political context and impacts of scientific practices; it likewise may study the consequences of new technologies on existing scientific fields.

==Academic study of history of science==
{{See also|Historiography of science|History of technology|History of mathematics}}
History of science is an academic discipline with an international community of specialists. Main professional organizations for this field include the [[History of Science Society]], the [[British Society for the History of Science]], and the European Society for the History of Science.

Much of the study of the history of science has been devoted to answering questions about what science ''is'', how it ''functions'', and whether it exhibits large-scale patterns and trends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dp1f03arcbYC&amp;q=What+is+science&amp;pg=PR11 |title=What is this thing called science? |publisher=Hackett Pub. |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-87220-452-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History of the academic study of history of science ===
{{Globalize|date=June 2022|section}}[[Historiography of science|Histories of science]] were originally written by practicing and retired scientists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reingold |first1=Nathan |year=1986 |title=History of Science Today, 1. Uniformity as Hidden Diversity: History of Science in the United States, 1980-1960 |journal=British Journal for the History of Science |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=243–262 |doi=10.1017/S0007087400023268|s2cid=145350145 }}&lt;/ref&gt; starting primarily with [[William Whewell|William Whewell's]] ''History of the Inductive Sciences'' (1837), as a way to communicate the virtues of science to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Snyder |first=Laura J. |title=William Whewell |date=2023 |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |editor-last=Zalta |editor-first=Edward N. |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/whewell/ |access-date=2025-03-09 |edition=Winter 2023 |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |editor2-last=Nodelman |editor2-first=Uri}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Auguste Comte]] proposed that there should be a specific discipline to deal with the history of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bourdeau |first1=Michel |title=Auguste Comte |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/comte/ |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |access-date=15 October 2023 |date=2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of the distinct [[Academia|academic]] discipline of the history of science and technology did not occur until the early 20th century.{{Citation needed|date=June 2022}} Historians have suggested that this was bound to the changing role of science during the same time period.{{Citation needed|date=June 2022}}

After [[World War I]], extensive resources were put into teaching and researching the discipline, with the hopes that it would help the public better understand both Science and Technology as they came to play an exceedingly prominent role in the world.{{Citation needed|date=June 2022}}

In the decades since the end of [[World War II]], history of science became an academic discipline, with [[graduate school]]s, [[research institute]]s, public and private patronage, [[peer-review]]ed [[Academic journal|journals]], and professional societies.{{Citation needed|date=June 2022}}

==== Formation of academic departments ====
{{Globalize|date=June 2022|section}}In the [[United States]], a more formal study of the history of science as an independent discipline was initiated by [[George Sarton]]'s publications, ''Introduction to the History of Science'' (1927) and the journal [[Isis (journal)|''Isis'']] (founded in 1912).{{Citation needed|date=June 2022}} Sarton exemplified the early 20th-century view of the history of science as the history of great men and great ideas.{{Citation needed|date=June 2022}} He shared with many of his contemporaries a [[Whig history#In the history of science|Whiggish]] belief in history as a record of the advances and delays in the march of progress.{{Citation needed|date=June 2022}}

The study of the history of science continued to be a small effort until the rise of [[Big Science]] after World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=The Science Before the War |url=https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/the-science-before-the-war |access-date=2025-03-13 |website=The New Atlantis |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the work of [[I. Bernard Cohen]] at [[Harvard University]], the history of science began to become an established subdiscipline of history in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dauben |first1=Joseph W. |last2=Gleason |first2=ML |last3=Smith |first3=GE |name-list-style=vanc |year=2009 |title=Seven Decades of History of Science |journal=Isis |volume=100 |issue=1 |pages=4–35 |doi=10.1086/597575 |pmid=19554868 |s2cid=31401544}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the influential bureaucrat [[Vannevar Bush]], and the president of Harvard, [[James Bryant Conant|James Conant]], both encouraged the study of the history of science as a way of improving general knowledge about how science worked, and why it was essential to maintain a large scientific workforce.{{Citation needed|date=June 2022}}

=== United States ===
Academic study of the history of science as an independent discipline was launched by [[George Sarton]] at Harvard with his book ''Introduction to the History of Science'' (1927) and the [[Isis (journal)|''Isis'' journal]] (founded in 1912).  Sarton exemplified the early 20th century view of the history of science as the history of great men and great ideas. He shared with many of his contemporaries a Whiggish belief in history as a record of the advances and delays in the march of progress. The History of Science was not a recognized subfield of American history in this period, and most of the work was carried out by interested Scientists and Physicians rather than professional Historians.&lt;ref&gt;Nathan Reingold, "History of Science Today, 1. Uniformity as Hidden Diversity: History of Science in the United States, 1920–1940," ''British Journal for the History of Science'' 1986 19(3): 243–262&lt;/ref&gt;  With the work of [[I. Bernard Cohen]] at Harvard, the history of Science became an established subdiscipline of history after 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Dauben | first1= JW | last2= Gleason | first2= ML | last3= Smith | first3= GE | title= Seven decades of history of science: I.

'''Technology''' is the application of [[Conceptual model|conceptual knowledge]] to achieve practical [[goal]]s, especially in a [[reproducible]] way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Skolnikoff |first=Eugene B. |year=1993 |title=The Elusive Transformation: Science, Technology, and the Evolution of International Politics |chapter=The Setting |page=13 |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |isbn=0-691-08631-1 |jstor=j.ctt7rpm1 |quote=I find the most useful conceptual definition for this study to be that given by Harvey Brooks, who has defined technology{{nbsp}}...as 'knowledge of how to fulfill certain human purposes in a specifiable and reproducible way.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''technology'' can also mean the products resulting from such efforts,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Salomon|1984|pages=117–118}}: "The first pole, that of the naturalisation of a new discipline within the university curriculum, was presented by Christian Wolff in 1728, in Chapter III of the "Preliminary discourse" to his ''{{lang|la|Philosophia rationalisis sive Logica}}'': 'Technology is the science of skills and works of skill, or, if one prefers, the science of things made by man's labour, chiefly through the use of his hands.'"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mitcham |first=Carl |author-link=Carl Mitcham |year=1994 |title=Thinking Through Technology: The Path Between Engineering and Philosophy |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |isbn=0-226-53196-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; including both tangible [[tool]]s such as [[Kitchen utensil|utensils]] or [[machine]]s, and intangible ones such as [[software]]. Technology plays a critical role in [[science]], [[engineering]], and [[everyday life]].

Technological advancements have led to significant changes in society. The earliest known technology is the [[stone tool]], used during [[prehistory]], followed by the [[control of fire]]—which in turn contributed to the [[Brain size|growth]] of the [[human brain]] and the development of [[language]] during the [[Pleistocene|Ice Age]], according to the [[cooking hypothesis]]. The invention of the [[wheel]] in the [[Bronze Age]] allowed greater travel and the creation of more complex machines. More recent technological inventions, including the [[printing press]], telephone, and the [[Internet]], have lowered barriers to communication and ushered in the [[knowledge economy]].

While technology contributes to [[economic development]] and improves human [[prosperity]], it can also have negative impacts like [[pollution]] and [[resource depletion]], and can cause social harms like [[technological unemployment]] resulting from [[automation]]. As a result, philosophical and [[Politics and technology|political debates]] about the role and use of technology, the [[ethics of technology]], and ways to mitigate its downsides are ongoing.

== Etymology ==
''Technology'' is a term dating back to the [[Renaissance|early 17th century]] that meant 'systematic treatment' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|Τεχνολογία}}, from the {{Langx|el|{{wikt-lang|el|τέχνη}}|tékhnē|craft, art}} and {{wikt-lang|grc|-λογία}} ({{transliteration|grc|-logíā}}), 'study, knowledge').''&lt;ref name="Liddell 1980"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Liddell |first1=Henry George |author1-link=Henry Liddell |last2=Scott |first2=Robert |author2-link=Robert Scott (philologist) |title=Greek-English Lexicon |title-link=Greek-English Lexicon |edition=Abridged |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=1996 |orig-date=1891 |isbn=0-19-910205-8 |oclc=38307662}}&lt;/ref&gt;''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |title=technology |encyclopedia=The Oxford English Dictionary |editor1-last=Simpson |editor1-first=J. |editor2-last=Weiner |editor2-first=Edmund |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1989 |isbn=978-0198611868}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is predated in use by the [[Ancient Greek]] word {{wikt-lang|grc|τέχνη}} ({{transliteration|grc|tékhnē}}), used to mean 'knowledge of how to make things', which encompassed activities like architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Aristotle |author-link=Aristotle |editor-last=Brown |editor-first=Lesley |translator-last=Ross |translator-first=David |year=2009 |title=The Nicomachean Ethics |page=105 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-19-921361-0 |lccn=2009005379 |oclc=246896490 |series=Oxford World's Classics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the 19th century, continental Europeans started using the terms {{lang|de|Technik}} (German) or {{lang|fr|technique}} (French) to refer to a 'way of doing', which included all technical arts, such as dancing, navigation, or printing, whether or not they required tools or instruments.{{Sfn|Salomon|1984|pages=114–115}} At the time, {{lang|de|Technologie}} (German and French) referred either to the academic discipline studying the "methods of arts and crafts", or to the political discipline "intended to legislate on the functions of the arts and crafts."{{Sfn|Salomon|1984|page=117}} The distinction between {{lang|de|Technik}} and {{lang|de|Technologie}} is absent in English, and so both were translated as ''technology''. The term was previously uncommon in English and mostly referred to the academic discipline, as in the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref name=jstor40061169&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Schatzberg |first=Eric |year=2006 |title="Technik" Comes to America: Changing Meanings of "Technology" before 1930 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/40061169 |journal=Technology and Culture |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=486–512 |doi=10.1353/tech.2006.0201 |jstor=40061169 |s2cid=143784033 |issn=0040-165X |access-date=10 September 2022 |archive-date=10 September 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220910165857/https://www.jstor.org/stable/40061169 |url-status=live |url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, as a result of [[Progress|scientific progress]] and the [[Second Industrial Revolution]], ''technology'' stopped being considered a distinct academic discipline and took on the meaning: the systemic use of knowledge to practical ends.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Salomon|1984|page=119}}: "With the industrial revolution and the important part England played in it, the word technology was to lose this meaning as the subject or thrust of a branch of education, as first in English and then in other languages it embodied all technical activity based on the application of science to practical ends."&lt;/ref&gt;

The 20th century brought a host of innovations. In physics, the discovery of [[nuclear fission]] in the [[Atomic Age]] led to both [[nuclear weapons]] and [[nuclear power]]. [[Analog computer]]s were invented and asserted dominance in processing complex data. While the invention of [[vacuum tube]]s allowed for digital computing with [[computer]]s like the [[ENIAC]], their sheer size precluded widespread use until innovations in [[quantum physics]] allowed for the invention of the [[transistor]] in 1947, which significantly compacted computers and led the digital transition. Information technology, particularly [[optical fiber]] and [[optical amplifier]]s, allowed for simple and fast long-distance communication, which ushered in the [[Information Age]] and the birth of the [[Internet]]. The [[Space Age]] began with the launch of [[Sputnik 1]] in 1957, and later the launch of [[Human spaceflight|crewed missions]] to the moon in the 1960s. Organized efforts to [[search for extraterrestrial intelligence]] have used [[radio telescope]]s to detect signs of technology use, or ''[[technosignature]]s'', given off by alien civilizations. In medicine, new technologies were developed for diagnosis ([[CT scan|CT]], [[Positron emission tomography|PET]], and [[MRI]] scanning), treatment (like the [[dialysis machine]], [[defibrillator]], [[pacemaker]], and a wide array of new [[pharmaceutical drug]]s), and research (like [[interferon]] cloning and [[DNA microarray]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Agar |first=J. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e2TrhBB_4fYC |title=Science in the 20th Century and Beyond |year=2012 |publisher=Polity |isbn=978-0745634692|access-date=11 September 2022 |archive-date=4 October 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221004184804/https://books.google.com/books?id=e2TrhBB_4fYC |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern technology increasingly relies on training and education&amp;nbsp;– their designers, builders, maintainers, and users often require sophisticated general and specific training.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Goldin |first1=C. |author1-link=Claudia Goldin |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yGlCFqnakCoC |title=The Race between Education and Technology |last2=Katz |first2=L.

Recent years have brought about a rise in social media's cultural prominence, with potential repercussions on democracy, and economic and social life. Early on, the internet was seen as a "liberation technology" that would democratize knowledge, improve access to education, and promote democracy. Modern research has turned to investigate the internet's downsides, including disinformation, polarization, hate speech, and propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/social-media-and-democracy/E79E2BBF03C18C3A56A5CC393698F117 |title=Social Media and Democracy: The State of the Field, Prospects for Reform |date=2020 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1108835558 |editor-last=Persily |editor-first=Nathaniel |series=SSRC Anxieties of Democracy |location=Cambridge |doi=10.1017/9781108890960 |hdl=11245.1/cf2f5b6a-8dc8-4400-bc38-3317b0164499 |s2cid=243715477 |editor-last2=Tucker |editor-first2=Joshua A. |access-date=19 October 2022 |archive-date=19 October 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221019091703/https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/social-media-and-democracy/E79E2BBF03C18C3A56A5CC393698F117 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, technology was seen as an extension of the human organism that replicated or amplified bodily and mental faculties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Brey |first=P. |year=2000 |editor-last=Mitcham |editor-first=C. |title=Theories of Technology as Extension of Human Faculties |journal=Metaphysics, Epistemology, and Technology.

Second-wave philosophers like Ortega later shifted their focus from economics and politics to "daily life and living in a techno-material culture", arguing that technology could oppress "even the members of the bourgeoisie who were its ostensible masters and possessors."

==Ethics==
{{main|Ethics of technology}}
The ''ethics of technology'' is an interdisciplinary subfield of ethics that analyzes technology's ethical implications and explores ways to mitigate potential negative impacts of new technologies. There is a broad range of ethical issues revolving around technology, from specific areas of focus affecting professionals working with technology to broader social, ethical, and legal issues concerning the role of technology in society and everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hansson |first=Sven Ove |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YeLaDwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=technology+ethics&amp;pg=PR7 |title=The Ethics of Technology: Methods and Approaches |year=2017 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |isbn=978-1783486595 |access-date=13 September 2022 |archive-date=4 October 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221004184810/https://books.google.com/books?id=YeLaDwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=technology+ethics&amp;pg=PR7 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent debates have surrounded [[genetically modified organism]]s, the use of robotic soldiers, [[algorithmic bias]], and the issue of [[AI alignment|aligning AI]] behavior with human values.&lt;ref name="Al-Rodhan"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Al-Rodhan |first=Nayef |title=The Many Ethical Implications of Emerging Technologies |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-many-ethical-implications-of-emerging-technologies/ |access-date=13 December 2019 |website=Scientific American  |archive-date=8 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170408081948/https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-many-ethical-implications-of-emerging-technologies/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology ethics encompasses several key fields: [[Bioethics]] looks at ethical issues surrounding biotechnologies and modern medicine, including cloning, human genetic engineering, and stem cell research. [[Computer ethics]] focuses on issues related to computing. [[Cyberethics]] explores internet-related issues like [[Intellectual property|intellectual property rights]], [[Internet privacy|privacy]], and [[Internet censorship|censorship]]. [[Nanoethics]] examines issues surrounding the alteration of matter at the atomic and molecular level in various disciplines including computer science, engineering, and biology. And [[engineering ethics]] deals with the professional standards of engineers, including [[software engineers]] and their moral responsibilities to the public.&lt;ref name="Luppicini, R. 20082"&gt;{{cite book |last=Luppicini |first=R. |title=Handbook of Research on Technoethics |publisher=Idea Group Publishing |year=2008 |editor1=Luppicini |location=Hershey |chapter=The emerging field of Technoethics |editor2=R. Adell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A wide branch of technology ethics is concerned with the [[ethics of artificial intelligence]]: it includes [[robot ethics]], which deals with ethical issues involved in the design, construction, use, and treatment of robots,&lt;ref name="Veruggio2002"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Veruggio, Gianmarco |year=2011 |title=The Roboethics Roadmap |journal=EURON Roboethics Atelier |publisher=Scuola di Robotica |page=2 |citeseerx=10.1.1.466.2810}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[machine ethics]], which is concerned with ensuring the ethical behavior of [[Intelligent agent|artificially intelligent agents]].&lt;ref name="Anderson2011"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Machine Ethics |date= 2011 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0521112352 |editor1-last=Anderson |editor1-first=Michael |editor2-last=Anderson |editor2-first=Susan Leigh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the field of AI ethics, significant yet-unsolved research problems include [[AI alignment]] (ensuring that AI behaviors are aligned with their creators' intended goals and interests) and the reduction of [[algorithmic bias]]. Some researchers have warned against the hypothetical risk of an [[AI takeover]], and have advocated for the use of [[AI capability control]] in addition to AI alignment methods.

Other fields of ethics have had to contend with technology-related issues, including [[military ethics]], [[media ethics]], and [[Philosophy of education|educational ethics]].

==Movements==

===Appropriate technology===
{{main|Appropriate technology}}
Some segments of the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s hippie counterculture]] grew to dislike urban living and developed a preference for [[Localism (politics)|locally autonomous]], [[sustainable]], and [[decentralized]] technology, termed ''appropriate technology''. This later influenced [[hacker culture]] and [[technopaganism]].

===Technological utopianism===
{{main|Technological utopianism}}

Technological utopianism refers to the belief that technological development is a [[moral good]], which can and should bring about a [[utopia]], that is, a society in which laws, governments, and social conditions serve the needs of all its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Segal |first=H.

The transhumanism movement is founded upon the "continued evolution of human life beyond its current human form" through science and technology, informed by "life-promoting principles and values."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |chapter=Roots and Core Themes |date=29 April 2013 |chapter-url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118555927.part1 |title=The Transhumanist Reader |pages=1–2 |editor-last=More |editor-first=M. |editor-link=Max More |edition= |publisher=Wiley |doi=10.1002/9781118555927.part1 |isbn=978-1118334294 |access-date=11 September 2022 |editor2-last=Vita-More |editor2-first=N. |editor2-link=Natasha Vita-More |archive-date=11 September 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220911102725/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118555927.part1 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement gained wider popularity in the early 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Istvan |first=Zoltan |date=1 February 2015 |title=A New Generation of Transhumanists Is Emerging |url=https://www.interaliamag.org/articles/a-new-generation-of-transhumanists-is-emerging/ |access-date=11 September 2022 |website=Interalia Magazine |archive-date=11 September 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220911102727/https://www.interaliamag.org/articles/a-new-generation-of-transhumanists-is-emerging/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Technological singularity|Singularitarians]] believe that machine superintelligence will "accelerate technological progress" by orders of magnitude and "create even more intelligent entities ever faster", which may lead to a pace of societal and technological change that is "incomprehensible" to us.

The earliest known revolt against technology was [[Luddism]], a pushback against early automation in textile production. Automation had resulted in a need for fewer workers, a process known as [[technological unemployment]].

Between the 1970s and 1990s, American terrorist [[Ted Kaczynski]] carried out a series of bombings across America and published the ''[[Industrial Society and Its Future|Unabomber Manifesto]]'' denouncing technology's negative impacts on nature and human freedom. The essay resonated with a large part of the American public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Kelman |first=David |date=1 June 2020 |title=Politics in a Small Room: Subterranean Babel in Piglia's El camino de Ida |url=https://utpjournals.press/doi/10.3138/ycl.63.005 |journal=The Yearbook of Comparative Literature |volume=63 |pages=179–201 |doi=10.3138/ycl.63.005 |s2cid=220494877 |issn=0084-3695 |access-date=11 September 2022 |archive-date=6 March 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220306190259/https://utpjournals.press/doi/10.3138/ycl.63.005 |url-status=live |url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was partly inspired by Jacques Ellul's ''[[The Technological Society]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fleming |first1=Sean |date=7 May 2021 |title=The Unabomber and the origins of anti-tech radicalism |journal=Journal of Political Ideologies |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=207–225 |doi=10.1080/13569317.2021.1921940 |issn=1356-9317 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this, modern technology is increasingly reliant on deep, domain-specific scientific knowledge. In 1975, there was an average of one citation of scientific literature in every three patents granted in the U.S.; by 1989, this increased to an average of one citation per patent. The average was skewed upwards by patents related to the pharmaceutical industry, chemistry, and electronics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Narin |first1=Francis |last2=Olivastro |first2=Dominic |date=1 June 1992 |title=Status report: Linkage between technology and science |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0048-7333%2892%2990018-Y |journal=Research Policy |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=237–249 |doi=10.1016/0048-7333(92)90018-Y |issn=0048-7333 |access-date=13 September 2022 |archive-date=4 October 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221004185326/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/004873339290018Y?via%3Dihub |url-status=live |url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2021 analysis shows that patents that are based on scientific discoveries are on average 26% more valuable than equivalent non-science-based patents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last1=Krieger |first1=Joshua L. |last2=Schnitzer |first2=Monika |author2-link=Monika Schnitzer | last3=Watzinger| first3=Martin|date=1 May 2019 |title=Standing on the Shoulders of Science |url=https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/21-128_6a36a0e5-7f30-4d63-a591-3196d4b3fb5e.pdf |ssrn=3401853 |access-date=12 September 2022 |archive-date=12 September 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220912192637/https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/21-128_6a36a0e5-7f30-4d63-a591-3196d4b3fb5e.pdf |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship of humanity with technology has been explored in science-fiction literature, for example in ''[[Brave New World]]'', ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]'', ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', [[Isaac Asimov]]'s essays, and movies like ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'', ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]'', ''[[Gattaca]]'', and ''[[Inception]]''. It has spawned the dystopian and futuristic [[cyberpunk]] genre, which juxtaposes futuristic technology with societal collapse, dystopia or decay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |contributor=Thomas Michaud|contribution=Science fiction and politics: Cyberpunk science fiction as political philosophy|pages=65–77 [75–76]|last= Hassler |first= Donald M. |title= New Boundaries in Political Science Fiction |publisher= [[University of South Carolina Press]] |year= 2008 |isbn= 978-1570037368}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable cyberpunk works include [[William Gibson]]'s ''[[Neuromancer]]'' novel, and movies like ''[[Blade Runner]]'', and ''[[The Matrix]]''.

{{More sources|date=October 2024}}

'''Robotic control''' is the system that contributes to the movement of [[robot]]s. This involves the mechanical aspects and programmable systems that makes it possible to control robots. [[Robotics]] can be controlled by various means including manual, [[wireless]], semi-[[autonomous]] (a mix of fully automatic and wireless control), and fully autonomous (using [[artificial intelligence]]).

== Modern robots (2000-present) ==

=== Medical and surgical ===
In the medical field, robots are used to make precise movements that are difficult for humans. Robotic surgery involves the use of less-invasive surgical methods, which are “procedures performed through tiny incisions”.&lt;ref&gt;Robotic surgery. (n.d.). &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/robotic-surgery/about/pac-20394974&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Robots use the [[Da Vinci Surgical System|da Vinci surgical method]], which involves the robotic arm (which holds onto surgical instruments) and a camera. The surgeon sits on a console where he controls the robot wirelessly. The feed from the camera is projected on a monitor, allowing the surgeon to see the incisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=What is Robotic Surgery? |url=https://www.uclahealth.org/medical-services/robotic-surgery/what-robotic-surgery |access-date=2024-03-01 |website=www.uclahealth.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system is built to mimic the movement of the surgeon’s hands and has the ability to filter slight hand tremors. But despite the visual feedback, there is no physical feedback. In other words, as the surgeon applies force on the console, the surgeon won’t be able to feel how much pressure he or she is applying to the tissue.

=== Military ===
The earliest robots used in the military dates back to the 19th century, where automatic weapons were on the rise due to developments in mass production. The first automated weapons were used in World War I, including radio-controlled, [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)]]'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, J. (1998). ''Warfare and History: Air Power in the Age of Total War''. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;McKenna, A. (2016). ''The Future of Drone Use: Opportunities and Threats from Ethical and Legal Perspectives'' (B. Custers, Ed.). The Hague, The Netherlands: T.M.C. Asser Press. {{doi|10.1007/978-94-6265-132-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the invention, the technology of ground and aerial robotic weapons continues to develop, it transitioned to become part of modern warfare. In the transition phase of the development, the robots were semi-automatic, being able to be controlled remotely by a human controller. The advancements made in [[sensor]]s and processors lead to advancements in capabilities of [[military robot]]s.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Military Robots and the Laws of War |url=https://www.brookings.edu/articles/military-robots-and-the-laws-of-war/ |access-date=2024-03-01 |website=Brookings |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the mid-20th century, the technology of [[Artificial intelligence|artificial intelligence (A.I.)]] began to develop&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Smith, C., McGuire, B., Huang, T., &amp; Yang, G. (2006, December). ''The history of artificial intelligence''. https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/csep590/06au/projects/history-ai.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 21st century, the technology transferred to warfare, and the weapons that were semi-automatous is developing to become [[lethal autonomous weapon]]s systems, LAWS for short.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Kessel |first1=Jonah M. |last2=Reneau |first2=Natalie |last3=Chan |first3=Melissa |date=2019-12-13 |title=Video: A.I. Is Making It Easier to Kill (You). Here's How. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/video/technology/100000006082083/lethal-autonomous-weapons.html |access-date=2024-03-01 |work=The New York Times |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Impact ====
As the weapons are being developed to become fully autonomous, there is an ambiguous line of what is the line that separates an enemy to a civilian. There is currently a debate of whether or not artificial intelligence is able to differentiate these enemies and the question of what is morally and humanely right (for example, a child unknowingly working for the enemies).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Space exploration ===
Space missions involve sending robots into space in the goal of discovering more of the unknown. The robots used in space exploration have been controlled semi-autonomously. The robots that are sent to space have the ability to maneuver itself, and are self-sustaining. To allow for data collection and a controlled research, the robot is always in communications with scientists and engineers on Earth'''.''' For the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA)]] [[Curiosity (rover)|Curiosity rover]], which is part of their Mars exploration program, the communication between the rover and the operators are made possible by “an international network of antennas that…permits constant observation of spacecraft as the Earth rotates on its own axis”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last= |title=Communications with Earth {{!}} Mission |url=https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission/communications |access-date=2024-03-01 |website=NASA Mars Exploration |date=30 November 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Artificial intelligence ===
[[Artificial intelligence|Artificial intelligence (AI)]] is used in robotic control to make it able to process and adapt to its surroundings. It is able to be programmed to do a certain task, for instance, walk up a hill. The technology is relatively new, and is being experimented in several fields, such as the military.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Boston Dynamics' robots ====
[[Boston Dynamics|Boston Dynamic’s]] “Spot” is an autonomous robot that uses four sensors and allows the robot to map where it is relative to its surroundings. The navigational method is called [[simultaneous localization and mapping]], or “SLAM” for short. Spot has several operating modes and depending on the obstacles in front of the robot, it has the ability to override the manual mode of the robot and perform actions successfully. This is similar to other robots made by Boston Dynamics, like the “Atlas”, which also has similar methods of control. When the “Atlas” is being controlled, the control software doesn’t explicitly tell the robot how to move its joints, but rather it employs mathematical models of the underlying physics of the robot’s body and how it interacts with the environment”. Instead of inputting data into every single joint of the robot, the engineers programmed the robot as a whole, which makes it more capable to adapt to its environment. The information in this source is dissimilar to other sources, except the second source, because robots vary so much depending on the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=How Boston Dynamics Is Redefining Robot Agility - IEEE Spectrum |url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-boston-dynamics-is-redefining-robot-agility |access-date=2024-03-01 |website=[[IEEE]] |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SnakeBot3.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A Gen 2 Snakebot from [[NASA]], demonstrating rearing capabilities.]]
A '''snakebot''', also referred to as a snake robot, is a [[biomorphic]] [[robot]] that resembles a [[snake]]. Snakebots have uses similar to those of certain types of [[Soft robotics|soft]] robots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Seeja |first1=G. |last2=Arockia Selvakumar Arockia |first2=Doss |last3=Berlin Hency |first3=V. |date=8 September 2022 |title=A Survey on Snake Robot Locomotion |journal=IEEE Access |volume=10 |pages=112109–112110 |bibcode=2022IEEEA..10k2100S |doi=10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3215162 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Snakebots can vary significantly in size and design. Their small cross-section-to-length ratios allow them to maneuver through tight spaces. Their ability to change shape allows them to traverse varied terrain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Liu |first1=Jindong |last2=Tong |first2=Yuchuang |last3=Liu |first3=Jinguo |date=18 April 2021 |title=Review of snake robots in constrained environments |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.robot.2021.103785 |journal=Robotics and Autonomous Systems |volume=141 |doi=10.1016/j.robot.2021.103785 |issn=0921-8890 |via=Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Snake robots are often designed by connecting multiple independent segments, which provides [[Redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]] and enables continued operation even if some parts are damaged. Snakebots have been posited for a range of practical applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Transeth|first1=Aksel Andreas|last2=Pettersen|first2=Kristin Ytterstad|title=2006 9th International Conference on Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision |chapter=Developments in Snake Robot Modeling and Locomotion |author2-link= Kristin Ytterstad Pettersen |date=Dec 2006|pages=1–8|doi=10.1109/ICARCV.2006.345142|isbn=978-1-4244-0341-7|s2cid=2337372}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Liljebäck|first1=P.|last2=Pettersen|first2=K.

A snakebot differs from a [[snake-arm robot]] in that, snakebots are usually self-contained, whereas snake-arm robots typically have mechanics remote from the arm itself, possibly connected to a larger system.{{Citation needed|date=October 2024}}

==Applications==
By mimicking the locomotion of snakes, snakebots can be used for tasks in multiple industries that traditional robots or human workers may find challenging or impossible to accomplish safely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Design and Motion Planning of a Mechanical Snake |url=https://ykoren.engin.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/122/2014/05/35.-Design-and-Motion-Planning-of-Mechanical-Snake.pdf |website=ykoren.engin.umich.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snakebots have been considered for the following applications:

* '''Search and rescue''': A snakebot was deployed for [[search and rescue]] after the [[2017 Puebla earthquake|September 2017 earthquake in Mexico City]].&lt;ref name=cm&gt;{{cite web |title=Carnegie Mellon Snake Robot Used in Search for Mexico Quake Survivors |url=https://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2017/september/snakebot-mexico.html |website=www.cmu.edu |language=en |date=September 27, 2017 |access-date=November 18, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Inspection and maintenance''': These robots can also be used for inspecting hard-to-reach areas, such as tubes, pipelines, bridges, and other infrastructure elements.&lt;ref name=cm/&gt;
* '''Medical applications''': In medical technology, miniature versions of Snakebots have been developed for endoscopic and minimally invasive procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Solberg |first1=Eirik |title=Biorobotics Lab at CMU Creates Bio-inspired Snakebot |url=https://www.oemcameras.com/blog/biorobotics-lab-at-cmu-creates-bio-inspired-snakebot/ |date=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the medical snakebot developed at [[Carnegie Mellon University]], which is capable of maneuvering around organs inside a human chest cavity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Medical Snake Robot |url=https://medrobotics.ri.cmu.edu/node/128447 |access-date=2024-10-23 |website=medrobotics.ri.cmu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Military and surveillance''': Due to their quiet, agile movement, snakebots are being considered for reconnaissance and surveillance tasks in military and defense settings.{{Citation needed|date=November 2024}}
* '''Space exploration''': Space agencies are exploring the use of snakebots to navigate extraterrestrial terrains, such as the rocky, uneven surfaces of Mars or the Moon,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=JPL's Snake-Like EELS Slithers Into New Robotics Terrain |url=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/jpls-snake-like-eels-slithers-into-new-robotics-terrain/ |access-date=2024-11-10 |website=NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=McDonald |first=Bob |date=May 12, 2023 |title=NASA engineers hope to send a robot snake to explore Saturn's icy moon Enceladus |url=https://www.cbc.ca/radio/quirks/nasa-engineers-hope-to-send-a-robot-snake-to-explore-saturn-s-icy-moon-enceladus-1.6841154 |access-date=November 9, 2024 |work=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; including steep craters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2024-12-10 |title='Snakes' on the moon?

An example is the [[Exobiology Extant Life Surveyor]] designed to explore the surface and the oceans of [[Enceladus]], a moon of Saturn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=How EELS could change the future of robotic exploration |url=https://www.planetary.org/articles/how-eels-could-change-the-future-of-robotic-exploration |access-date=2024-12-10 |website=The Planetary Society |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Locomotion==
Traditional Snakebots move by changing the shape of their body, similar to actual snakes. Many variants have been created that use wheels or treads for movement. There has yet to be any Snakebots that accurately approximate the locomotion of real snakes. However, researchers have produced new movement methods that do not occur in nature.{{Citation needed|date=September 2024}} 

In snakebot research, a [[gait]] is a periodic mode of locomotion/movement. [[Sidewinding]] and [[lateral undulation]] are both examples of gaits. Snakebot gaits are often designed by investigating period changes to the shape of the robot. For example, a [[caterpillar]] moves by changing the shape of its body to match a [[sinusoidal wave]]. Similarly, a snakebot can move by adapting its shape to different periodic functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Snakebot |url=https://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/nelson/courses/csc_robocon/robot_manual/snakebot/snakebot.html |access-date=2024-10-16 |website=www.cs.rochester.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Crotalus cerastes|Sidewinder rattlesnakes]] can ascend sandy slopes by increasing the portion of their bodies in contact with the sand to match the reduced yielding force of the inclined sand, allowing them to ascend [[Angle of repose|the maximum possible sand slope]] without slip.&lt;ref name="sciencemag1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marvi |first=Hamidreza |url=https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1255718 |title=Sidewinding with minimal slip: Snake and robot ascent of sandy slopes |journal=Science |date=2014-10-10 |volume=346 |issue=6206 |pages=224–229 |doi=10.1126/science.1255718 |pmid=25301625 |arxiv=1410.2945 |bibcode=2014Sci...346..224M |s2cid=23364137 |accessdate=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snakebots that side-wind can replicate this ascent.&lt;ref name="sciencemag1" /&gt;

==Current research==
Snakebots are currently being researched as a new type of [[robotic]], [[Interplanetary spaceflight|interplanetary]] [[Space probe|probe]] by engineers at the [[NASA Ames Research Center]]. Software for snakebots is also being developed by [[NASA]], so that they can learn by experiencing the skills to scale obstacles and remembering the techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last= |title=JPL's Snake-Like EELS Slithers Into New Robotics Terrain |url=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/jpls-snake-like-eels-slithers-into-new-robotics-terrain |access-date=2024-05-07 |website=NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="2966" sha1="4e6z4quxm4o5qcs6v3dejn6nzpubi9y" xml:space="preserve">'''Seamless branching''' is a space-saving mechanism used on [[Blu-ray Disc]]s and, rarely, [[DVD]]s, to allow multiple versions of a film to be stored on a disc without storing redundant scenes several times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Sitter |first1=Martin |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4vgqh33rFpsC&amp;dq=%22seamless+branching%22+-wikipedia&amp;pg=PA397 |title=Apple Pro Training Series: DVD Studio Pro 4 |last2=Ramseier |first2=Adrian |last3=Carman |first3=Robbie |date=2009-09-04 |publisher=Peachpit Press |isbn=978-0-13-208939-5 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One example is the Signature Edition DVD of ''[[The Iron Giant]]'', where the user can select between the original theatrical version and an extended version. The two versions differ only in a few scenes. The DVD player is instructed to play the film normally except for these scenes, then jump to the appropriate scene as selected by the user before the commencement of the film, and then jump back to play the rest of the film. The disc is authored in a way which allows the joins to be invisible, hence the term ''seamless''. (An example of a non-seamless branched title is the DVD version of ''[[The Lion King]]''). Larger scale examples of the same technique are seen in the 2000 Ultimate Edition DVD of ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2023-11-27 |title=Terminator 2 : L'édition limitée 4K Endo Skull disponible à partir du 29 novembre |url=https://www.hdnumerique.com/actualite/articles/20262-t2-4k-endo-skull.html |access-date=2023-12-31 |website=www.hdnumerique.com |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 2007 DVD rerelease of ''[[Blade Runner]]'', the Platinum and Diamond Edition DVDs of ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', and the 4K Ultra HD version of ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2023-10-27 |title=Conan le Barbare (1982) et Conan le Destructeur (1984) en 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray le 16 janvier chez Arrow Video |url=https://www.hdnumerique.com/actualite/articles/20220-conan-barbare-usa-uhd.html |access-date=2023-12-31 |website=www.hdnumerique.com |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which three different cuts of the films are playable from the same discs.

Another possible use of seamless branching is for the localisation (translation) of on-screen visible text. The ''[[Star Wars]]'' DVDs with their [[Star Wars opening crawl|opening crawl]] are a prime example. Normally, only the audio track of films is translated into other languages, but when text central to the plot is visible on-screen, the scene may be created once for every language, and the DVD player can be instructed to select the appropriate version of the scene depending on the user's language preference. However, for this purpose a technique called [[multi-angle]] is used more often.

'''Impairment detection technology''' (IDT) refers to tools and systems designed to assess whether an individual is [[Disability|functionally impaired]] at a given moment, regardless of the cause. Unlike [[Breathalyzer test|drug and alcohol tests]] that detect substances or their [[metabolite]]s in the body, IDTs evaluate real-time [[Cognition|cognitive]] or physical performance to identify active impairment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Impairment Detection - National Safety Council |url=https://www.nsc.org/workplace/safety-topics/impairment/impairment-detection?srsltid=AfmBOorGiHi3JyGzm0SldS1KPyU6jt2YuVBcPJ0lGQ2X3Y-EdViIYCHL |access-date=2025-05-13 |website=www.nsc.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Spindle |first1=Tory R. |last2=Martin |first2=Erin L. |last3=Grabenauer |first3=Megan |last4=Woodward |first4=Thomas |last5=Milburn |first5=Michael A. |last6=Vandrey |first6=Ryan |date=July 2021 |title=Assessment of cognitive and psychomotor impairment, subjective effects, and blood THC concentrations following acute administration of oral and vaporized cannabis |journal=Journal of Psychopharmacology  |volume=35 |issue=7 |pages=786–803 |doi=10.1177/02698811211021583 |issn=1461-7285 |pmc=9361180 |pmid=34049452}}&lt;/ref&gt; These systems are relevant where safety is critical, such as [[Workplace safety standards|workplaces]] and [[law enforcement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Impairment Detection Technology Makes Workplaces Safer - National Safety Council |url=https://www.nsc.org/newsroom/impairment-detection-technology-makes-workplaces-s?srsltid=AfmBOopbMT9pBSIQv79F2pd1_svjtj9ud6B8PRY34sa6_AXP-6cIJpju |access-date=2025-05-13 |website=www.nsc.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title='Impairment Detection Technology and Workplace Safety': NSC releases report {{!}} 2022-08-18 {{!}} Safety+Health |url=https://www.safetyandhealthmagazine.com/articles/22945-impairment-detection-technology-and-workplace-safety-nsc-releases-report |access-date=2025-05-13 |website=www.safetyandhealthmagazine.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IDTs do not identify the specific cause of impairment, such as [[Substance use disorder|drug use]], [[fatigue]], or illness, but instead detect behavioral or [[Physiology|physiological markers]] like slowed reaction time, poor coordination, or eye movement abnormalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Artificial Vision Systems for Mobility Impairment Detection: Integrating Synthetic Data, Ethical Considerations, and Real-World Applications |url=https://www.mdpi.com/3309932 |website=MDPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interest in IDT has increased as workplaces and law enforcement agencies address the limitations of traditional drug testing methods. The [[legalization of cannabis]] has underscored challenges associated with [[metabolite]]-based tests, which can yield [[False positives and false negatives|positive results]] days after use, even when the individual is no longer impaired.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |last=harvardgazette |date=2022-01-11 |title=Harvard-led research identifies potential test for cannabis impairment |url=https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2022/01/research-describes-brain-based-method-for-identifying-cannabis-impairment/ |access-date=2025-05-22 |website=Harvard Gazette |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies indicate that [[tetrahydrocannabinol]] (THC) levels in blood or saliva do not reliably correlate with functional impairment, as frequent users may retain high THC concentrations without experiencing intoxication, and metabolites may remain detectable long after [[Psychoactive drug|psychoactive]] effects have ended.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Types ==
IDTs assess an individual’s functional state in real time by monitoring cognitive performance or physiological responses. These technologies fall into several categories:

=== Oculomotor  ===
These systems analyze involuntary eye movements and [[Pupillary light reflex|pupil responses]], such as [[nystagmus]] or delayed reactions to detect impairment. Devices like Gaize’s [[Virtual reality headset|VR headset]] use [[Eye tracking|eye-tracking]] sensors and [[Machine learning in bioinformatics|machine learning]] to detect intoxication based on ocular behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=What impairment measurement standards does Gaize use? |url=https://www.gaize.ai/blog/what-impairment-measurement-standards-does-gaize-use |access-date=2025-05-22 |website=Gaize |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychomotor ===
Digital tests measure [[Mental chronometry|reaction time]], [[attention]], and coordination to detect cognitive deficits due to fatigue or substances. The [[Psychomotor vigilance task|Psychomotor Vigilance Test]] (PVT), widely used in fatigue studies, has been shown to detect [[alertness]] lapses in professional drivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Zhang |first=Chunbai |last2=Varvarigou |first2=Vasileia |last3=Parks |first3=Philip D. |last4=Gautam |first4=Shiva |last5=Bueno |first5=Antonio Vela |last6=Malhotra |first6=Atul |last7=Kales |first7=Stefanos N. |date=March 2012 |title=Psychomotor vigilance testing of professional drivers in the occupational health clinic: a potential objective screen for daytime sleepiness |url=https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3742032/ |journal=Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine |volume=54 |issue=3 |pages=296–302 |doi=10.1097/JOM.0b013e318223d3d6 |issn=1536-5948 |pmc=3742032 |pmid=21826029}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Physiological ===
Wearables and in-vehicle systems detect drowsiness or impairment by monitoring [[Blinking|eye blinks]], head movement, or steering behavior. Some advanced devices use brain-scanning methods like [[functional near-infrared spectroscopy]] (fNIRS) to identify cannabis related changes in brain activity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; From 2024, the [[European Union|EU]] mandates drowsiness detection systems in all new vehicles to enhance [[Road safety in Europe|road safety]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Mandatory drivers assistance systems expected to help save over 25,000 lives by 2038 - European Commission |url=https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/news/mandatory-drivers-assistance-systems-expected-help-save-over-25000-lives-2038-2024-07-05_en |access-date=2025-05-22 |website=single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gerontechnology''', also called '''[https://books.google.de/books/about/Gerotechnology.html?id=hJjSCgAAQBAJ&amp;redir_esc=y gerotechnology]''' is an inter- and multidisciplinary academic as well as a professional field that combines various disciplines of [[gerontology]] and [[technology]]. Sustainability of an aging society depends on our effectiveness in creating technological environments, including [[assistive technology]] and [[inclusive design]], for innovative and independent living and social participation of older adults in any state of health, comfort as well as safety. In short, gerontechnology concerns matching technological environments to [[health]], [[housing]], mobility, [[communication]], [[leisure]], work and also the personality/individual dispositions of older people. Gerontechnology is most frequently identified as a subset of HealthTech and is -- since the 2010s -- more commonly referred to as AgeTech or Agetech in Europe and the United States. Research outcomes form the basis for [[designers]], [[Construction worker|builders]], [[engineers]], [[manufacturers]], and those in the health professions ([[nursing]], [[medicine]], [[gerontology]], [[geriatrics]], [[environmental psychology]], [[developmental psychology]], etc.), to provide an optimum living environment for the widest range of ages.

== Description ==
Gerontechnology is considered an adjunct to the promotion of human [[health]] and [[well-being|physical as well as emotional well-being]]. It pertains to both human development and aging with the aim to compress [[morbidity]] and to increase [[vitality]] and [[quality of life]] throughout the lifespan. It creates solutions to extend the working phase in society by maximizing the vital and productive years in the later years of life, which consequently reduces the cost of care.

The overall framework of gerontechnology may be seen as a matrix of domains of human activity: (1) health &amp; self-esteem, housing &amp; [[activities of daily living]], communication &amp; governance, mobility &amp; transport, work &amp; leisure, as well as (2) technology interventions or impact levels (enhancement &amp; satisfaction, prevention &amp; engagement, compensation &amp; assistance, care and care organisation). Underpinning all these elements are generic and applied [[evidence-based]] research findings that aid in the development of products and services.

Gerontechnology has much in common with other interdisciplinary domains, such as [[Assistive Technology]] (for the compensation &amp; assistance and the care support &amp; care organisation rows of the matrix), [https://www.tumblr.com/everybodytech Everybodytech], Technology for All (for example [https://www.technology4all.org/ Technology 4 All.org]) and [[Universal Design]] for the development of all products and services pertaining to gerontechnology.

== Gerontological design ==
Gerontological design focuses on providing effective solutions to improve the way of life for aging people, through gerontological knowledge and [[design research]] methods to obtain a better understanding of individuals' preferences and requirements.

Gerontological design also refers specifically to the study and practice of building design methods that support older users in the built environment.  Some universities host professors, commonly in architecture or interior design departments, that specialize in the study and teaching of this design specialization. Not only does this include the examination of building design characteristics that impact older adults' physiological well-being, but it can also include the investigation of building design characteristics that impact informational needs (i.e. finding one's way around in a space) or social interaction needs (Campbell, 2012).

Between 2008 and 2030, [[Singapore]] will witness an age profile shift in its population's history. In 2005, one in 12 residents was 65 years or older. By 2030, one in five residents will be 65 years or older.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ministry of Community Development, Committee on Ageing Issues |year=2006 |title=Report on the Ageing population. Demographic Realities: Opportunities and Challenges |accessdate=July 31, 2008 |url=http://www.mcys.gov.sg/successful_ageing/report/CAI_report.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071028115440/http://www.mcys.gov.sg/successful_ageing/report/CAI_report.pdf |archivedate=October 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies show that in 2002, 7% of the world's population is aged 65 and above. By 2050, it is envisaged that the percentage could rise to nearly 17%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=U.S. Census Bureau|date=March 2004|title=Global population at a glance: 2002 and beyond. International Brief (Report No. WP/02-1)|location=Washington, DC|accessdate=July 31, 2008|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/wp02-1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Population ageing|ageing population]] and its impact on [[economics]], [[politics]], [[education]] and [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] is no longer an isolated issue but a global concern. Products and services relevant to the "silver industry" or the "mature market" increasingly abound in the marketplace. The demand for designers with a keen sense for the aging population's needs who employ gerontological design process knowledge concomitantly rises.

== Publications ==
An international academic journal with delayed open-access, ''Gerontechnology'' [https://journal.gerontechnology.org/], is published by the '''International Society for Gerontechnology (ISG)''' [http://www.gerontechnology.org].

A comprehensive volume titled ''Gerontechnology'' [http://www.springerpub.com/gerontechnology-9780826128881.html] edited by [[Sunkyo Kwon]] has been published in 2016/2017.

== Applications ==
Age technology (AgeTech/Agetech) has been used to enhance aspects of insurance, domiciliary care, residential and nursing homes, health care, and risk management. The services may originate from various independent service providers or the interconnection of devices and services enabled through open APIs. Commercial businesses with an ageing component including the opportunities around the “Silver Economy” – providing services for the ‘wants’ of the older demographic, supporting independent living – addressing the ‘needs’ of the older demographic, longevity – extending healthy lifespan and geroscience.

In the US, startup Aging2.0 launched in 2015 and has since organized 170 meet-up events, opened volunteer chapters in 30 countries and signed up 30 companies for its own accelerator program. Amongst these, SingFit “makes it easy for everyone to become a music therapist”, WalkJoy is a wearable sensor that measures a person’s gait and alerts caregivers when someone could be about to fall. Active Protective is a personal airbag that inflates to stop someone breaking their hip. And Vynca records a person’s dying wishes, so families aren’t unsure when the time comes. The company Honor, which connects seniors, caregivers and their families, recently raised $20 million, the biggest funding in the emerging category so far. In Europe, London-based AgeTech startup Birdie secured a €7 million Series A to help elderly adults live independently while independent living system Kraydel has raised over £1m in innovation and public sector grants to develop its smart device which sits on top of the TV, linking elderly people to their carers or family members, through their TV screens.

== Education ==
[[File:SetupResearch.jpg|thumb]] The first ISG Masterclass [https://web.archive.org/web/20070320052817/http://www.phe.bwk.tue.nl/ISGMasterClass/Main_mclass.htm] for PhD students in 2006 produced a scheme to support gerontechnological research.

=== Media about the history of technology ===
* ''[[Connections (British documentary)|Connections]]'' &amp;ndash; documentary television series and 1978 book ("Connections" based on the series) created, written and presented by science historian James Burke. It took an interdisciplinary approach to the history of science and invention and demonstrated how various discoveries, scientific achievements, and historical world events were built from one another successively in an interconnected way to bring about particular aspects of modern technology. There were 3 seasons produced, and they aired in 1978, 1994, and 1997. 
* ''[[The Day the Universe Changed]]'' &amp;ndash; documentary television series written and presented by science historian James Burke, originally broadcast in 1985 by the BBC. The series' primary focus is on the effect of advances in science and technology on western society in its philosophical aspects. Ran for one season, in 1986.

== Hypothetical technology ==
Potential technology of the future includes:

[[Hypothetical technology]]
* [[Femtotechnology]] &amp;ndash; hypothetical term used in reference to structuring of matter on the scale of a femtometer, which is 10−15 m. This is a smaller scale in comparison to nanotechnology and picotechnology which refer to 10−9 m and 10−12 m respectively. Work in the femtometer range involves manipulation of excited energy states within atomic nuclei (see nuclear isomer) to produce metastable (or otherwise stabilized) states with unusual properties.

{{distinguish|Technocriticism}}

'''Criticism of technology''' is an analysis of adverse impacts of industrial and [[digital electronics|digital]] technologies. It is argued that, in all advanced industrial societies (not necessarily only capitalist ones), technology becomes a means of domination, control, and exploitation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History and Philosophy of Science and Technology|last1=Lorenzano|first1=Pablo|authorlink2=Hans-Jörg Rheinberger|last2=Rheinberger|first2=Hans-Jörg|last3=Ortiz|first3=Eduardo|last4=Galles|first4=Carlos|publisher=EOLSS Publishers Co. Ltd.|year=2010|isbn=9781848267763|location=Oxford|pages=124–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; or more generally something which threatens the survival of humanity.  Some of the technology opposed by the most radical critics may include everyday household products, such as [[refrigerator]]s, [[Home computer|computers]], and [[medication]].&lt;ref name="GlendinningChellis"&gt;[[Chellis Glendinning|Glendinning, Chellis]]. ''[https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/chellis-glendinning-notes-toward-a-neo-luddite-manifesto Notes towards a Neo-Luddite manifesto]''. Utne Reader, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; However, criticism of technology comes in many shades.

==Overview==

Some authors such as [[Chellis Glendinning]] and [[Kirkpatrick Sale]] consider themselves [[Neo-Luddism|Neo-Luddites]] and hold that technological progress has had a negative impact on humanity. Their work focused on seeking meaning out of technological change, specifically wrestling with the question of "how tools and their affordances change and alter the fabric of everyday life."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cjr.org/tow_center_reports/constructive_technology_criticism.php/|title=Toward a Constructive Technology Criticism|last=Watson|first=Sara|date=October 2016|work=Columbia Journalism Review|access-date=2018-10-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ellul, for instance, maintained that when people assert that technology is an instrument of freedom or the means to achieve historical destiny or the execution of divine vocation, it results in the glorification and sanctification of Technique so that it becomes that which gives meaning and value to life rather than mere ensemble of materials.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Jacques Ellul and the Technological Society in the 21st Century|last1=Jeronimo|first1=Helena|last2=Garcia|first2=Jose|last3=Mitcham|first3=Carl|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media|year=2013|isbn=9789400766570|location=Dordrecht|pages=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is echoed by [[rhetoric]]al critics who cite the way technological discourse damages institutions and individuals who make up those institutions due to its idealization and capacity to define [[Hierarchy|social hierarchies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Rhetoric and Composition: Communication from Ancient Times to the Information Age|last=Enos|first=Theresa|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=978-0824072001|location=New York|pages=619}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its most extreme, criticisms of technology produce analyses of technology as potentially leading to catastrophe. For instance, activist [[Naomi Klein]] described how technology is employed by capitalism in its commitment to a "shock doctrine", which promotes a series of crises so that speculative profit can be accumulated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are theorists who also cite the [[2008 financial crisis]] as well as the [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] and [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima]] disasters to support their critique.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Critiques also focus on specific issues such as how technology—through [[robotics]], [[automation]], and [[software]]—is destroying people's jobs faster than it is creating them, contributing to the incidence of poverty and inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/515926/how-technology-is-destroying-jobs/|title=How Technology Is Destroying Jobs|last=Rotman|first=David|work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2018-10-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s in the US, the critique of technology became the basis of a new political perspective called [[anarcho-primitivism]], which was forwarded by thinkers such as [[Fredy Perlman]], [[John Zerzan]], and [[David Watson (anarchist)|David Watson]]. They proposed differing theories about how it became an industrial society, and not capitalism as such, that was at the root of contemporary social problems. This theory was developed in the journal [[Fifth Estate (periodical)|''Fifth Estate'']] in the 1970s and 1980s, and was influenced by the [[Frankfurt School]], the [[Situationist International]], [[Jacques Ellul]] and others.

The critique of technology overlaps with the [[philosophy of technology]] but whereas the latter tries to establish itself as an academic discipline the critique of technology is basically a political project, not limited to [[academia]]. It features prominently in [[neomarxism|neo-Marxist]] ([[Herbert Marcuse]] and [[Andrew Feenberg]]), [[ecofeminism]] ([[Vandana Shiva]]) and in [[Postdevelopment theory|post development]] ([[Ivan Illich]])

A [[hypothetical technology]] is a technology that does not exist yet, but that has potential to exist in the future. 

Hypothetical technologies are distinct from [[List of emerging technologies|emerging technologies]], which are new actual technologies, or developing technological fields presenting useful advances. 

As there is often only a thin line between fiction and hypothesis, this category may have considerable overlap with [[fictional technology]].

Hypothetical technologies listed here should be:

* currently no such thing in actual existence
* not proven to be impossible
* not merely a (name for a) fictional idea

{{distinguish|Virtualization}}

'''Virtual environment software''' refers to any [[software]], program or system that implements, manages and controls multiple [[virtual environment]] instances (self definition).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Jaydeep |first=koyani |title=Characteristics of Virtualization |date=20 August 2018 |url=https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/characteristics-of-virtualization/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The software is installed within an organization's existing [[IT infrastructure]] and controlled from within the organization itself. From a central interface, the software creates an interactive and immersive experience for administrators and users.

==Uses==
Virtual environment software can be purposed for any use, from advanced military training in a virtual environment simulator to virtual classrooms. Many Virtual Environments are being purposed as branding channels for products and services by enterprise corporations and non-profit groups.

[[virtual event|Virtual events]] and [[virtual tradeshow|virtual tradeshows]] have been the early accepted uses of virtual event services. More recently, virtual environment software platforms have offered choices to enterprises – with the ability to connect people across the Internet. Virtual environment software enables organizations to extend their market and industry reach while reducing (all travel-related) costs and time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=sciencedirect |journal=Tourism Management |date=August 2023 |volume=97 |doi=10.1016/j.tourman.2023.104724 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261517723000067 |last1=Buhalis |first1=Dimitrios |last2=Leung |first2=Daniel |last3=Lin |first3=Michael |hdl=10397/99151 |hdl-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Providers of virtual environments have tended to focus on the early marketplace adoption of virtual events. These providers are typically [[software as a service]] (SaaS)-based. Most have evolved from the streaming media/gaming arena and social networking applications.

This early virtual event marketplace is now moving towards 3D persistent environments, where enterprises combine e-commerce, social media as core operating systems, and is evolving into virtual environments for branding, customer acquisition, and service centers. A [[persistent environment]] enables users, visitors and administrators to re-visit a part or parts of the event or session. Information gathered by attendees and end users is typically stored in a virtual briefcase typically including contact information and marketing materials.

{{Sociology}}
'''Technology, society and life''' or '''technology and culture''' refers to the inter-dependency, [[co-dependence]], co-influence, and [[co-production (society)|co-production]] of [[technology]] and [[society]] upon one another. Evidence for this [[synergy]] has been found since humanity first started using simple tools. The inter-relationship has continued as modern technologies such as the [[printing press]] and [[computer]]s have helped shape society. The first scientific approach to this relationship occurred with the development of [[tektology]], the "science of organization", in early twentieth century [[Imperial Russia]].&lt;ref name="AD&amp;ST"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gare |first1=Arran |title=Aleksandr Bogdanov and Systems Theory |journal=Democracy &amp; Nature |date=November 2000 |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=341–359 |doi=10.1080/10855660020020230 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248981084 |language=en|hdl=1959.3/751 |hdl-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern academia, the interdisciplinary study of the mutual impacts of science, technology, and society, is called [[science and technology studies]].

The simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic [[tool]]s. The [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] discovery of [[Control of fire by early humans|how to control fire]] and the later [[Neolithic Revolution]] increased the available sources of food, and the invention of the [[wheel]] helped humans to travel in and control their environment. Developments in historic times have lessened physical barriers to [[communication]] and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale, such as the [[printing press]], [[telephone]], and [[Internet]].

Technology has developed advanced [[Economy|economies]], such as the modern  [[Economic globalization|global economy]], and has led to the rise of a [[Conspicuous leisure|leisure class]]. Many technological processes produce by-products known as [[pollution]], and deplete natural resources to the detriment of Earth's [[Natural environment|environment]]. Innovations influence the [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] of society and raise new questions in the [[ethics of technology]]. Examples include the rise of the notion of [[efficiency]] in terms of human [[productivity]], and the challenges of [[bioethics]].

Philosophical debates have arisen over the use of technology, with disagreements over whether technology improves the [[human condition]] or worsens it. [[Neo-Luddism]], [[anarcho-primitivism]], and similar [[reactionary]] movements criticize the pervasiveness of technology, arguing that it harms the environment and alienates people. However, proponents of ideologies such as [[transhumanism]] and [[techno-progressivism]] view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the [[human condition]].

==Pre-historical==
The importance of [[stone tool]]s, circa 2.5 million years ago, is considered fundamental in the human development in the [[hunting hypothesis]].{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

Primatologist, [[Richard Wrangham]], theorizes that the [[control of fire by early humans]] and the associated development of cooking was the spark that radically changed human evolution.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Catching Fire: How Cooking Made Us Human]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Texts such as ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]'' suggest that early advances in plant agriculture and husbandry fundamentally shifted the way that collective groups of individuals, and eventually societies, developed.

==Modern examples and effects==
Technology has taken a large role in society and day-to-day life. When societies know more about the development in a technology, they become able to take advantage of it. When an innovation achieves a certain point after it has been presented and promoted, this technology becomes part of the society. The use of technology in education provides students with technology literacy, information literacy, capacity for life-long learning, and other skills necessary for the 21st century workplace.&lt;ref name=Puricelli&gt;{{harv|Puricelli|2011|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Digital electronics|Digital technology]] has entered each process and activity made by the [[social system]]. In fact, it constructed another worldwide [[communication system]] in addition to its origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Rückriem|2009|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1982 study by ''[[The New York Times]]'' described a technology assessment study by the [[Institute for the Future]], "peering into the future of an electronic world." The study focused on the emerging videotex industry, formed by the marriage of two older technologies, communications, and computing. It estimated that 40 percent of American households will have two-way videotex service by the end of the century. By comparison, it took television 16 years to penetrate 90 percent of households from the time commercial service was begun.

Since the creation of [[computer]]s achieved an entire better approach to transmit and store [[data]]. Digital technology became commonly used for downloading music and watching movies at home either by [[DVD]]s or purchasing it online.
Digital music records are not quite the same as traditional recording media. Obviously, because [[digital media|digital]] ones are reproducible, portable and free.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Katz|2010|page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the globe many schools have implemented [[educational technology]] in primary schools, universities and colleges. According to the statistics, in the early beginnings of 1990s the use of Internet in schools was, on average, 2–3%.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} Continuously, by the end of 1990s the [[Technological evolution|evolution of technology]] increases rapidly and reaches to 60%, and by the year of 2008 nearly 100% of schools use Internet on educational form. According to ISTE researchers, technological improvements can lead to numerous achievements in classrooms. E-learning system, collaboration of students on project based learning, and technological skills for future results in motivation of students.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}

Although these previous examples only show a few of the positive aspects of technology in society, there are negative side effects as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Lynden|first1 = Burke|title = Generation Y Heavily Dependent On Technology, Promotes Laziness|url = http://www.thejambar.com/generation-y-heavily-dependent-on-technology-promotes-laziness/|website = The Jambar| date=12 May 2011 |access-date = 28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this virtual realm, social media platforms such as [[Instagram]], [[Instagram|Facebook]], and [[Snapchat]] have altered the way [[Millennials|Generation Y culture]] is understanding the world and thus how they view themselves. In recent years, there has been more research on the development of social media depression in users of sites like these. "Facebook Depression" is when users are so affected by their friends' posts and lives that their own jealousy depletes their sense of self-worth. They compare themselves to the posts made by their peers and feel unworthy or monotonous because they feel like their lives are not nearly as exciting as the lives of others.&lt;ref name=Puricelli/&gt;

Technology has a serious effect on youth's health. The overuse of technology is said to be associated with sleep deprivation which is linked to obesity and poor academic performance in the lives of adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;Saudi med J. 2016 pages 436–439&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics and technological development==
[[File:Doel Kerncentrale.JPG|thumb|Nuclear reactor, [[Doel]], [[Belgium]]]]

In ancient history, [[economics]] began when spontaneous exchange of goods and services was replaced over time by deliberate trade structures. Makers of arrowheads, for example, might have realized they could do better by concentrating on making arrowheads and barter for other needs. Regardless of goods and services bartered, some amount of technology was involved—if no more than in the making of shell and bead jewelry. Even the shaman's potions and sacred objects can be said to have involved some technology. So, from the very beginnings, technology can be said to have spurred the development of more elaborate economies. Technology is seen as primary source in economic development.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [[Andrey Korotayev]], Artemy Malkov, and Daria Khaltourina. [https://www.academia.edu/35443515/Introduction_to_Social_Macrodynamics_Compact_Macromodels_of_the_World_System_Growth._Moscow_KomKniga_2006 ''Introduction to Social Macrodynamics: Compact Macromodels of the World System Growth''] {{ISBN|5-484-00414-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology advancement and economic growth are related to each other. The level of technology is important to determine the economic growth. It is the technological process which keeps the economy moving.

In the modern world, superior technologies, resources, geography, and history give rise to robust economies; and in a well-functioning, robust economy, economic excess naturally flows into greater use of technology. Moreover, because technology is such an inseparable part of human society, especially in its economic aspects, funding sources for (new) technological endeavors are virtually illimitable. However, while in the beginning, technological investment involved little more than the time, efforts, and skills of one or a few men, today, such investment may involve the collective labor and skills of many millions.

Most recently, because of the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], the proportion of firms employing advanced digital technology in their operations expanded dramatically. It was found that firms that adopted technology were better prepared to deal with the pandemic's disruptions. Adaptation strategies in the form of remote working, 3D printing, and the use of big data analytics and AI to plan activities to adapt to the pandemic were able to ensure positive job growth.&lt;ref name=":344"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Bank |first=European Investment |url=https://www.eib.org/en/publications/digitalisation-in-europe-2021-2022 |title=Digitalisation in Europe 2021-2022: Evidence from the EIB Investment Survey |date=2022-05-05 |publisher=European Investment Bank |isbn=978-92-861-5233-7 |language=EN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Digital transformation: importance, benefits and EU policy - EU monitor |url=https://www.eumonitor.eu/9353000/1/j9vvik7m1c3gyxp/vli6iyjgcqxh?ctx=vl8zi7xkljtm |access-date=2022-05-31 |website=www.eumonitor.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Productivity gains from teleworking in the post COVID-19 era: How can public policies make it happen? |url=https://www.oecd.org/coronavirus/policy-responses/productivity-gains-from-teleworking-in-the-post-covid-19-era-how-can-public-policies-make-it-happen-a5d52e99/ |access-date=2022-05-31 |website=OECD |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funding===
Consequently, the sources of funding for large technological efforts have dramatically narrowed, since few have ready access to the collective labor of a whole society, or even a large part. It is conventional to divide up funding sources into governmental (involving whole, or nearly whole, social [[Organization|enterprises]]) and private (involving more limited, but generally more sharply focused) business or individual enterprises.

====Government funding for new technology====
The government is a major contributor to the development of new technology in many ways. In the United States alone, many government agencies specifically invest billions of dollars in new technology.

In 1980, the UK government invested just over six million pounds in a four-year program, later extended to six years, called the [[Microelectronics Education Programme]] (MEP), which was intended to give every school in Britain at least one computer, software, training materials, and extensive teacher training. Similar programs have been instituted by governments around the world.

Technology has frequently been driven by the military, with many modern applications developed for the military before they were adapted for civilian use. However, this has always been a two-way flow, with industry often developing and adopting a technology only later adopted by the military.

Entire government agencies are specifically dedicated to research, such as America's [[National Science Foundation]], the United Kingdom's [[List of UK government scientific research institutes|scientific research institutes]], America's [[Small Business Innovation Research|Small Business Innovative Research]] effort. Many other government agencies dedicate a major portion of their budget to research and development.

====Private funding====
[[Research and development]] is one of the smallest areas of investments made by corporations toward new and innovative technology.
{{citation needed|date=April 2022}}

Many foundations and other nonprofit organizations contribute to the development of technology. In the [[OECD]], about two-thirds of [[research and development]] in scientific and technical fields is carried out by industry, and 98 percent and 10 percent, respectively, by [[University|universities]] and government. But in poorer countries such as [[Portugal]] and [[Mexico]] the industry contribution is significantly less. The U.S. government spends more than other countries on military research and development, although the proportion has fallen from about 30 percent in the 1980s to less than 10 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url-status=dead |url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/49/45/24236156.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060723051956/http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/49/45/24236156.pdf|archive-date=July 23, 2006 |website=OECD |title=Key Figures }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2009 founding of [[Kickstarter]] allows individuals to receive funding via [[crowdsourcing]] for many technology related products including both new physical creations as well as documentaries, films, and web-series that focus on [[technology management]]. This circumvents the corporate or government oversight most inventors and artists struggle against but leaves the accountability of the project completely with the individual receiving the funds.

===Other economic considerations===
* [[Appropriate technology]], sometimes called "intermediate" technology, more of [[Index of economics articles|an economics concern]], refers to compromises between central and expensive technologies of [[Developed country|developed nations]] and those that [[Developing country|developing nations]] find most effective to deploy given an excess of labour and scarcity of cash.
*[[Persuasive technology|Persuasion technology]]: In [[economics]], definitions or assumptions of progress or [[economic growth|growth]] are often related to one or more assumptions about technology's economic influence. Challenging prevailing assumptions about technology and its usefulness has led to alternative ideas like [[uneconomic growth]] or [[Quality of life|measuring well-being]]. These, and economics itself, can often be described as technologies, specifically, as persuasion technology.

==Relation to science==
The relationship between [[science]] and technology can be complex.  Science may drive technological development, by generating demand for new instruments to address a scientific question, or by illustrating technical possibilities previously unconsidered.  An environment of encouraged science will also produce scientists and engineers, and technical schools, which encourages innovation and entrepreneurship that are capable of taking advantage of the existing science.  In fact, it is recognized that "innovators, like scientists, do require access to technical information and ideas" and "must know enough to recognize useful knowledge when they see it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11077-011-9137-3.pdf | doi=10.1007/s11077-011-9137-3 | title=Science, technology and innovation in a 21st century context | date=2011 | last1=Marburger | first1=John H. | journal=Policy Sciences | volume=44 | issue=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Science spillover also contributes to greater technological diffusion.&lt;ref&gt;Otsuka, Kozo. 2007. "Role of Science and Technology on Knowledge Production Function: The Case of Japan and USA". ''International Journal of Technology, Knowledge and Society'' 3 (4): 17–26. {{doi|10.18848/1832-3669/CGP/v03i04/55764}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Having a strong policy contributing to basic science allows a country to have access to a strong a knowledge base that will allow them to be "ready to exploit unforeseen developments in technology,"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Stokes, Donald E. 1997. ''Pasteur's Quadrant : Basic Science and Technological Innovation''. Print. Washington, D.C., United States of America: Brookings Institution Press.&lt;/ref&gt; when needed in times of crisis.

For most of human history, technological improvements were arrived at by chance, trial and error, or spontaneous inspiration.  Stokes referred to these innovators as {{"'}}improvers of technology'…who knew no science and would not have been helped by it if they had."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  This idea is supported by Diamond who further indicated that these individuals are "more likely to achieve a breakthrough if [they do] not hold the currently dominant theory in too high regard."&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Arthur M, Jr. 2019. ''Openness to Creative Destruction: Sustaining Innovative Dynamism''. Kindle. New York, United States of America: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Research and development]] directed towards immediate technical application is a relatively recent occurrence, arising with the [[Industrial Revolution]] and becoming commonplace in the 20th century.  In addition, there are examples of economies that do not emphasize science research that have been shown to be technological leaders despite this.  For example, the United States relied on the scientific output of Europe in the early 20th century, though it was regarded as a leader in innovation. Another example is the technological advancement of Japan in the latter part of the same century, which emphasized more applied science (directly applicable to technology).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Though the link between science and technology has need for more clarity, what is known is that a society without sufficient building blocks to encourage this link are critical.  A nation without emphasis on science is likely to eventually stagnate technologically and risk losing competitive advantage.  The most critical areas for focus by policymakers are discouraging too many protections on job security, leading to less mobility of the workforce,&lt;ref&gt;Soete, Luc. 2002. "The European Research Area: Perspectives and Opportunities". ''Prepared for the International Workshop on Research Incentives and Institutions, Italian Ministry of Economics and Finance''. Paper. Rome, Italy.&lt;/ref&gt; encouraging the reliable availability of sufficient low-cost capital for investment in R&amp;D, by favorable economic and tax policies,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Aghion, Phillippe, Paul A David, and Dominique Foray. 2009. "Science, Technology and Innovation for Economic Growth:  Linking Policy Research and Practice in 'STIG Systems{{'"}}. ''Research Policy'', no. 38 (March).&lt;/ref&gt; and supporting higher education in the sciences to produce scientists and engineers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Sociological factors and effects==
{{See also|Social construction of technology}}

===Values===
The implementation of technology influences the [[Value (ethics)#Personal and cultural values|values]] of a society by changing expectations and realities. The implementation of technology is also influenced by values. There are (at least) three major, interrelated values that inform, and are informed by, technological innovations:
*[[Mechanism (philosophy)|Mechanistic world view]]: Viewing the universe as a collection of parts (like a machine), that can be individually analyzed and understood.&lt;ref name = McGinn&gt;{{harv|McGinn|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a form of [[reductionism]] that is rare nowadays. However, the "neo-mechanistic world view" holds that nothing in the universe cannot be understood by the human intellect. Also, while all things are greater than the sum of their parts (e.g., even if we consider nothing more than the information involved in their combination), in principle, even this excess must eventually be understood by human intelligence. That is, no [[Divinity|divine]] or [[Vitalism|vital]] principle or essence is involved.
*[[Efficiency (economics)|Efficiency]]: A value, originally applied only to machines, but now applied to all aspects of society, so that each element is expected to attain a higher and higher percentage of its maximal possible performance, output, or ability.
*Social [[progress]]: The belief that there is such a thing as social progress, and that, in the main, it is beneficent. Before the [[Industrial Revolution]], and the subsequent explosion of technology, almost all societies believed in a [[cyclical theory]] of social movement and, indeed, of all history and the universe. This was, obviously, based on the cyclicity of the seasons, and an agricultural economy's and society's strong ties to that cyclicity. Since much of the world is closer to their agricultural roots, they are still much more amenable to cyclicity than progress in history. This may be seen, for example, in Prabhat Rainjan Sarkar's modern social cycles theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.metafuture.org/sarkar/prabhat.htm | title=Prabhat rainjan sarkar's social cycles, world unity and peace; Renaissance 2000 honoring Sarkar's 75th Anniversary, LA 1 | work=Metafuture.org | access-date=July 6, 2016 | author=Galtung, Johan}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a more westernized version of social cyclicity, see ''Generations: The History of America's Future, 1584 to 2069'' (Paperback) by Neil Howe and William Strauss; Harper Perennial; Reprint edition (September 30, 1992); {{ISBN|0-688-11912-3}}, and subsequent books by these authors.

====Institutions and groups====
Technology often enables organizational and bureaucratic group structures that otherwise and heretofore were simply not possible. Examples of this might include:
*The rise of very large organizations: e.g., governments, the military, health and social welfare institutions, supranational corporations.
*The commercialization of leisure: sports events, products, etc. (McGinn)
*The almost instantaneous dispersal of information (especially news) and entertainment around the world.

===International===
Technology enables greater knowledge of international issues, values, and cultures. Due mostly to mass transportation and mass media, the world seems to be a much smaller place, due to the following:&lt;ref name="ubiquity"&gt;{{cite web |title=21st century information technology revolution |url=https://ubiquity.acm.org/article.cfm?id=1399619 |website=ubiquity.acm.org |access-date=|date=4 March 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Globalization of ideas
*Embeddedness of values
*Population growth and control

==Environment==
{{See also|Environmental technology|Design|Human impact on the environment#Technology impacts}}
[[File:Heavy Traffic, Heavy Haze - another day in China.jpg|thumb|Smog caused by the invention, construction, dissemination and use of car-technology and -infrastructure alongside possibly less than suboptimal product- and [[Production (economics)|industrial production]]-designs]]
Technology can provide understanding of and appreciation for the world around us, enable [[sustainability]] and improve environmental conditions but also degrade the environment and facilitate unsustainability.

Some [[polity|polities]] may conclude that certain technologies' environmental detriments and other risks to outweigh their benefits, especially if or once substitutive technologies have been or can be invented, leading to directed technological phase-outs such as the [[fossil fuel phase-out]] and the [[nuclear power phase-out|nuclear fission power phase-out]].

Most modern technological processes produce unwanted byproducts in addition to the desired products, which are known as [[waste]] and [[pollution]]. While material waste is often re-used in [[industrial processes]], many processes lead to a release into the environment with negative environmental side effects, such as pollution and lack of sustainability.

;Development and technologies' implications
Some technologies are designed specifically with the environment in mind, but most are designed first for financial or economic effects such as the free market's [[profit motive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Martin |first1=Kirsten |last2=Shilton |first2=Katie |last3=Smith |first3=Jeffery |title=Business and the Ethical Implications of Technology: Introduction to the Symposium |journal=Journal of Business Ethics |date=2019-12-01 |volume=160 |issue=2 |pages=307–317 |doi=10.1007/s10551-019-04213-9 |language=en |issn=1573-0697|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of a specific technology is often not only dependent on how it is used – e.g. its usage context – but also predetermined by the technology's design or characteristics, as in the theory of "[[the medium is the message]]" which relates to media-technologies in specific. In many cases, such predetermined or built-in implications may vary depending on factors of contextual contemporary conditions such as human biology, [[International relations theory|international relations]] and socioeconomics. However, many technologies may be harmful to the environment only when used in specific contexts or for specific purposes that not necessarily result from the nature of the technology.

;Values
Historically, from the perspective of economic agent-centered responsibility, an increased, as of 2021 commonly theoretic and informal, value of healthy environments and more efficient productive processes may be the result of an increase in the [[wealth]] of society. Once people are able to provide for their [[basic needs]], they can – and are often facilitated to – not only afford more environmentally destructive products and services, but could often also be able to put an – e.g. individual [[morality]]-motivated – effort into valuing less tangible goods such as clean air and water if product-, alternatives-, consequences- and services-information are adequate.

From the perspective of [[systems science]] and [[cybernetics]], economies (systems) have economic actors and sectors make decisions based upon a range of system-internal factors with structures – or sometimes forms of leveraging existing structures – that lead to other outcomes being the result of other architectures – or systems-level configurations of the existing designs – which are considered to be possible in the sense that such could be modeled, tested, priorly [[Impact assessment|assessed]], developed and studied.

=== Negative effects on the environment ===
The effects of technology on the environment are both obvious and subtle. The more obvious effects include the depletion of nonrenewable natural resources (such as petroleum, coal, ores, and precious metals), and the added [[air pollution|pollution of air]], water, and land. The more subtle effects may include long-term effects (e.g. [[global warming]], [[deforestation]], [[Habitat destruction|natural habitat destruction]], and coastal wetland loss.)

;Pollution and energy requirements
Each wave of technology creates a set of waste previously unknown by humans: [[toxic waste]], [[radioactive waste]], [[electronic waste]], [[plastic waste]], and [[space waste]].

Electronic waste creates direct environmental impacts through the production and maintaining the infrastructure necessary for using technology and indirect impacts by breaking barriers for global interaction through the use of information and communications technology.&lt;ref&gt;Higón, D. A., Gholami, R., Shirazi, F. , [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0736585316305846 "ICT and environmental sustainability: A global perspective"], ''Telematics and Informatics'', 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Certain usages of information technology and infrastructure maintenance consume energy [[greenhouse gas emissions#By sector|that contributes global warming]]. This includes software-designs such as international [[cryptocurrencies]]&lt;ref name="10.1038/s41467-021-22256-3"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jiang |first1=Shangrong |last2=Li |first2=Yuze |last3=Lu |first3=Quanying |last4=Hong |first4=Yongmiao |last5=Guan |first5=Dabo |last6=Xiong |first6=Yu |last7=Wang |first7=Shouyang |title=Policy assessments for the carbon emission flows and sustainability of Bitcoin blockchain operation in China |journal=Nature Communications |date=6 April 2021 |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=1938 |doi=10.1038/s41467-021-22256-3 |pmid=33824331 |pmc=8024295 |bibcode=2021NatCo..12.1938J |language=en |issn=2041-1723|doi-access=free }} [[File:CC-BY icon.svg|50px]] Available under [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ CC BY 4.0].&lt;/ref&gt; and most hardware powered by nonrenewable sources.

One of the main problems is the lack of societal [[decision-making]] processes – such as the contemporary [[economy]] and [[politics]] – that lead to sufficient implementation of existing as well as potential efficient ways to remove, recycle and prevent these pollutants on a large scale expediently.

Digital technologies, however, are important in achieving the [[Just transition|green transition]] and specifically, the [[Sustainable Development Goals|SDGs]] and  [[European Green Deal]]'s environmental targets. Emerging digital technologies, if correctly applied, have the potential to play a critical role in addressing environmental issues. A few examples are: smart city mobility, [[precision agriculture]], sustainable supply chains, [[environmental monitoring]], and catastrophe prediction.&lt;ref name=":34"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Bank |first=European Investment |url=https://www.eib.org/en/publications/digitalisation-in-europe-2021-2022 |title=Digitalisation in Europe 2021-2022: Evidence from the EIB Investment Survey |date=2022-05-05 |publisher=European Investment Bank |isbn=978-92-861-5233-7 |language=EN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=The potential of digital business models in the new energy economy – Analysis |url=https://www.iea.org/articles/the-potential-of-digital-business-models-in-the-new-energy-economy |access-date=2022-06-05 |website=IEA |date=7 January 2022 |language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction and shaping==

===Choice===
Society also controls technology through the choices it makes. These choices not only include consumer demands; they also include:
*the channels of distribution, how do products go from raw materials to consumption to disposal;
*the cultural beliefs regarding style, freedom of choice, consumerism, materialism, etc.;
*the economic values we place on the environment, individual wealth, government control, capitalism, etc.

According to Williams and Edge,&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Williams|Edge|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; the construction and shaping of technology includes the concept of choice (and not necessarily conscious choice). Choice is inherent in both the design of individual artifacts and systems, and in the making of those artifacts and systems.

The idea here is that a single technology may not emerge from the unfolding of a predetermined logic or a single determinant, technology could be a garden of forking paths, with different paths potentially leading to different technological outcomes. This is a position that has been developed in detail by [[Judy Wajcman]]. Therefore, choices could have differing implications for society and for particular social groups.

===Autonomous technology===
In one line of thought, technology develops autonomously, in other words, technology seems to feed on itself, moving forward with a force irresistible by humans. To these individuals, technology is "inherently dynamic and self-augmenting."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|McGinn|1991|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Ellul]] is one proponent of the irresistibleness of technology to humans. He espouses the idea that humanity cannot resist the temptation of expanding our knowledge and our technological abilities. However, he does not believe that this seeming autonomy of technology is inherent. But the perceived autonomy is because humans do not adequately consider the responsibility that is inherent in technological processes.

[[Langdon Winner]] critiques the idea that [[Radovan Richta|technological evolution]] is essentially beyond the control of individuals or society in his book Autonomous Technology. He argues instead that the apparent autonomy of technology is a result of "technological somnambulism," the tendency of people to uncritically and unreflectively embrace and utilize new technologies without regard for their broader social and political effects.

In 1980, [[Mike Cooley (engineer)|Mike Cooley]] published a critique of the automation and computerisation of engineering work under the title "Architect or Bee? The human/technology relationship".  The title alludes to a comparison made by [[Karl Marx]], on the issue of the creative achievements of human imaginative power.&lt;ref&gt;cf Karl Marx, ''[[Capital, Volume I]]''&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cooley ""Scientific and technological developments have invariably proved to be double-edged. They produced the beauty of Venice and the hideousness of Chernobyl; the caring therapies of Rontgen's X-rays and the destruction of Hiroshima,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Expert stresses designs which are orientated towards people |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/expert-stresses-designs-which-are-orientated-towards-people-1.82744 |access-date=2023-08-28 |newspaper=The Irish Times |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government===
Individuals rely on governmental assistance to control the side effects and negative consequences of technology.
*Supposed independence of government. An assumption commonly made about the government is that their governance role is neutral or independent. However, some argue that governing is a political process, so government will be influenced by political winds of influence. In addition, because government provides much of the funding for technological research and development, it has a vested interest in certain outcomes. Other point out that the world's biggest ecological disasters, such as the [[Aral Sea]], [[Chernobyl]], and [[Lake Karachay]] have been caused by government projects, which are not accountable to consumers.
*Liability. One means for controlling technology is to place responsibility for the harm with the agent causing the harm. Government can allow more or less legal liability to fall to the organizations or individuals responsible for damages.
*Legislation. A source of controversy is the role of industry versus that of government in maintaining a clean environment. While it is generally agreed that industry needs to be held responsible when pollution harms other people, there is disagreement over whether this should be prevented by legislation or civil courts, and whether ecological systems as such should be protected from harm by governments.

Recently, the [[social shaping of technology]] has had new influence in the fields of [[E-Science|e-science]] and [[e-social science]] in the United Kingdom, which has made centers focusing on the social shaping of [[Science and technology studies|science and technology]] a central part of their funding programs.

Technology that is outdated (such as the [[8-track tape|8-track]]) or no longer used at all (such as the [[telegraph]]). Not all old technology belongs here - for example, while [[vinyl record]]s were replaced by [[audio cassette]]s and [[CD]]s in the [[1980s]], they are making a comeback as a physical format as non-physical formats have made the CD and cassette obsolete, while vinyl is slowly becoming more common again (see [[vinyl revival]] for details).

Another example is an [[analog watch]]; though digital watches are a newer technology, they have not entirely replaced traditional watches because of the aesthetic or functional value of the original.

Most cloud file storage providers offer limited free use but charge for additional storage once the free limit is exceeded. These costs are usually charged as a monthly subscription rate and have different rates depending on the amount of storage desired.

In 2018, cloud services revenue was about $182.4 billion and in 2022 it is projected to grow to $331.2 billion. The cloud storage industry was projected to grow 17.2 percent in 2019 (Costello, 2019).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Costello |first1=Katie |title=Gartner Forecasts Worldwide Public Cloud Revenue to Grow 17.5 Percent in 2019 |url=https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2019-04-02-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-public-cloud-revenue-to-g |accessdate=13 August 2019 |publisher=Gartner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The concept of cloud computing trace back to '''1960s''', when the groundwork for modern internet and network technologies was being laid (Human for humans, 2024). One of the pivotal figures in this early period was J.C.R. Licklider, a visionary computer scientist who worked on '''ARPANET, the precursor to the internet'''. Licklider's ideas set the stage for the development of distributed computing systems, which are fundamental to cloud computing. Moving into the '''1990s''', AT&amp;T introduced '''PersonaLink Services''', a more advanced online platform offering electronic mail and online storage. 

'''Major turning point in 2006'''

The launch of Amazon Web Services (AWS) in 2006 marked a major turning point. AWS introduced '''Amazon S3''' (Simple Storage Service), which allowed businesses and developers to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. This development was revolutionary, providing scalable, reliable, and low-cost data storage infrastructure that transformed how organizations managed their data.

== Applications ==
Some mobile device manufacturers include mobile [[cloud storage]] apps with their product. These apps facilitate [[File synchronization|synchronization]] of user files across multiple platforms. Part of the process for setting up new mobile devices frequently includes configuring a [[cloud storage service]] to [[Backup]] the device's files and information. [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[iOS]] devices come pre-loaded and configured to use Apple's mobile cloud storage service [[iCloud]].  [[Google]] offers a similar feature with the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] operating system by backing up the device using a [[Google Drive]] account. The [[Samsung Galaxy]] smartphone has partnered with [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]], while [[Microsoft]] similarly offers [[Microsoft OneDrive]].

Some mobile cloud storage apps are platform-independent. For example, [[Nasuni]]'s Mobile Access app is available on any [[Android (operating system)|Android]] or [[iOS]] device.

Most companies offering [[Cloud storage|Cloud Storage]] have [[secure website]]s to access files allowing use on any device that can browse the [[Internet]].

[[File:Pyrenean Ibex.png|thumb|right|The [[Pyrenean ibex]], also known as the bouquetin (French) and bucardo (Spanish), is the only animal to have survived de-extinction past birth through cloning.]]
'''De-extinction''' (also known as '''resurrection biology''', or '''species revivalism''') is the process of generating an [[organism]] that either resembles or is an [[Extinction|extinct]] [[organism]].&lt;ref name="NYT-201703202"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/20/science/revive-restore-extinct-species-dna-mammoth-passenger-pigeon.html|title=We Might Soon Resurrect Extinct Species. Is It Worth the Cost?|last=Yin|first=Steph|date=20 March 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several ways to carry out the process of de-extinction. [[Cloning]] is the most widely proposed method, although genome editing and [[selective breeding]] have also been considered. Similar techniques have been applied to certain [[endangered species]], in hopes to boost their [[genetic diversity]]. The only method of the three that would provide an animal with the same genetic identity is cloning.&lt;ref name=":04"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Sherkow|first1=Jacob S.|last2=Greely|first2=Henry T.|date=2013-05-05|title=What If Extinction Is Not Forever?|journal=Science|volume=340|issue=6128|pages=32–33|doi=10.1126/science.1236965|pmid=23559235 |bibcode=2013Sci...340...32S |hdl=2142/111005 |url=https://digitalcommons.nyls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1019&amp;=&amp;context=fac_other_pubs&amp;=&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=https%253A%252F%252Fscholar.google.com%252Fscholar%253Fhl%253Den%2526as_sdt%253D0%25252C10%2526q%253Dde%252Bextinction%2526oq%253Ddeext#search=%22de%20extinction%22|hdl-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are benefits and drawbacks to the process of de-extinction ranging from technological advancements to ethical issues.

==Methods==
===Cloning===
[[File:Pyrenean ibex Cloning.svg|thumb|Pictured above is the process used to clone the [[Pyrenean ibex]]. The tissue culture was taken from the last living, female Pyrenean ibex named Celia. The egg was taken from a [[goat]] (''Capra hircus'') and the nucleus removed to ensure the offspring was purely Pyrenean ibex. The egg was implanted into a surrogate goat mother for development.]]

[[Cloning]] is a commonly suggested method for the potential restoration of an extinct [[species]]. It can be done by extracting the nucleus from a preserved cell from the extinct species and swapping it into an egg, without a nucleus, of that species' nearest living relative.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Shapiro |first=Beth |date=2016-08-09 |title=Pathways to de-extinction: How close can we get to resurrection of an extinct species? |journal=[[Functional Ecology]] |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=996–1002 |doi=10.1111/1365-2435.12705 |doi-access=free |bibcode=2017FuEco..31..996S |issn=0269-8463 |s2cid=15257110}}&lt;/ref&gt; The egg can then be inserted into a host from the extinct species' nearest living relative. This method can only be used when a preserved cell is available, meaning it would be most feasible for recently extinct species.&lt;ref name=":122"&gt;{{cite news |title=Should we bring extinct species back from the dead? |last=Shultz |first=David |date=2016-09-23 |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |publisher=[[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS]] |url=https://www.science.org/content/article/should-we-bring-extinct-species-back-dead|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cloning has been used by scientists since the 1950s.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Wadman |first=Meredith |year=2007 |title=Dolly: A decade on |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=445 |issue=7130 |pages=800–801 |doi=10.1038/445800a |doi-access=free |pmid=17314939 |s2cid=6042005}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most well known clones is [[Dolly (sheep)|Dolly the sheep]]. Dolly was born in the mid-1990s and lived normally until the abrupt midlife onset of health complications resembling premature aging, that led to her death.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; Other known cloned animal species include domestic cats, dogs, pigs, and horses.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt;

=== Genome editing ===
[[Genome editing]] has been rapidly advancing with the help of the CRISPR/Cas systems, particularly CRISPR/Cas9. The CRISPR/Cas9 system was originally discovered as part of the bacterial immune system.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Palermo|first1=Giulia|last2=Ricci|first2=Clarisse G.|last3=McCammon|first3=J. Andrew|date=April 2019|title=The invisible dance of CRISPR-Cas9. Simulations unveil the molecular side of the gene-editing revolution.|journal=Physics Today|volume=72|issue=4|pages=30–36|doi=10.1063/PT.3.4182|issn=0031-9228|pmc=6738945|pmid=31511751}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viral DNA that was injected into the bacterium became incorporated into the bacterial chromosome at specific regions. These regions are called clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, otherwise known as CRISPR. Since the viral DNA is within the chromosome, it gets transcribed into RNA. Once this occurs, the Cas9 binds to the RNA. Cas9 can recognize the foreign insert and cleaves it.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; This discovery was very crucial because the Cas protein can now be viewed as a scissor in the genome editing process.

By using cells from a closely related species to the extinct species, genome editing can play a role in the de-extinction process. Germ cells may be edited directly, so that the egg and sperm produced by the extant parent species will produce offspring of the extinct species, or somatic cells may be edited and transferred via somatic cell nuclear transfer. The result is an animal which is not completely the extinct species, but rather a hybrid of the extinct species and the closely related, non-extinct species. Because it is possible to sequence and assemble the genome of extinct organisms from highly degraded tissues, this technique enables scientists to pursue de-extinction in a wider array of species, including those for which no well-preserved remains exist.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; However, the more degraded and old the tissue from the extinct species is, the more fragmented the resulting DNA will be, making genome assembly more challenging.

=== Back-breeding ===
{{main|Breeding back}}

Back breeding is a form of selective breeding. As opposed to breeding animals for a trait to advance the species in selective breeding, back breeding involves breeding animals for an ancestral characteristic that may not be seen throughout the species as frequently.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Pathways to de-extinction: how close can we get to resurrection of an extinct species?|journal=Functional Ecology|volume=31|issue=5|pages=996–1002|last=Shapiro|first=Beth|s2cid=15257110|doi=10.1111/1365-2435.12705|year=2017|doi-access=free|bibcode=2017FuEco..31..996S }}&lt;/ref&gt; This method can recreate the traits of an extinct species, but the genome will differ from the original species.&lt;ref name=":122"/&gt; Back breeding, however, is contingent on the ancestral trait of the species still being in the population in any frequency.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Back breeding is also a form of artificial selection by the deliberate selective breeding of domestic animals, in an attempt to achieve an animal breed with a phenotype that resembles a wild type ancestor, usually one that has gone extinct.{{citation needed|date=May 2025}}

===Iterative evolution===
{{main|Elvis taxon}}
A natural process of de-extinction is iterative evolution. This occurs when a species becomes extinct, but then after some time a different species evolves into an almost identical creature. For example, the Aldabra rail was a flightless bird that lived on the island of [[Aldabra]]. It had evolved some time in the past from the flighted [[white-throated rail]], but became extinct about 136,000 years ago due to an unknown event that caused sea levels to rise. About 100,000 years ago, sea levels dropped and the island reappeared, with no fauna. The white-throated rail recolonized the island, but soon evolved into a flightless species physically identical to the extinct species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hume|first1=Julian P.|last2=Martill|first2=David|date=2019-05-08|title=Repeated evolution of flightlessness in ''Dryolimnas'' rails (Aves: Rallidae) after extinction and recolonization on Aldabra|journal=Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society|volume=186|issue=3|pages=666–672|doi=10.1093/zoolinnean/zlz018|url=https://academic.oup.com/zoolinnean/article/186/3/666/5487031}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Harris|first=Glenn|url=https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/715178|title=The bird that came back from the dead|website=EurekAlert!|date=2019-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Herbarium specimens for de-extincting plants===
{{see also|List of longest-living organisms#Revived into activity after stasis}}
Not all extinct plants have herbarium specimens that contain seeds. Of those that do, there is ongoing discussion on how to coax barely alive embryos back to life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marinelli |first1=Janet |title=Back from the Dead: New Hope for Resurrecting Extinct Plants |url=https://e360.yale.edu/features/plant-de-extinctions-herbariums |website=Yale Environment 360 |date=12 July 2023|publisher=Yale School of the Environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Judean date palm]] and [[Commiphora#Ancient seed|tsori]].

=== In-vitro fertilisation and artificial insemination ===
{{Main|In vitro fertilisation|Artificial insemination}}
In-vitro fertilisation and artificial insemination are [[Assisted reproductive technology|assisted reproduction technology]] commonly used to treat [[infertility]] in humans. However, it has usage as a viable option for de-extinction in cases of [[functional extinction]] where all remaining individuals are of the same sex, incapable of naturally reproducing, or suffer from low genetic diversity such as the northern white rhinoceros, Yangtze giant softshell turtle, ''Hyophorbe amaricaulis'', [[baiji]], and vaquita.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; For example, viable embryos are created from preserved sperm from deceased males and [[Egg cell|ova]] from living females are implemented into a surrogate species.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

== Advantages of de-extinction ==

The technologies being developed for de-extinction could lead to large advances in various fields:
* An advance in genetic technologies that are used to improve the cloning process for de-extinction could be used to prevent endangered species from becoming extinct.&lt;ref name="e360.yale.edu"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://e360.yale.edu/features/the_case_for_de-extinction_why_we_should_bring_back_the_woolly_mammoth|title=De-Extinction Debate: Should We Bring Back the Woolly Mammoth?|last=Brand|first=Stewart|date=2014-01-13|website=Yale Environment 360|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* By studying revived previously extinct animals, cures to diseases could be discovered.
* Revived species may support conservation initiatives by acting as "[[flagship species]]" to generate public enthusiasm and funds for conserving entire ecosystems.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bennett|first1=Joseph|date=25 March 2015|title=Biodiversity gains from efficient use of private sponsorship for flagship species conservation|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society|volume=282|issue=1805|pages=20142693|doi=10.1098/rspb.2014.2693|pmc=4389608|pmid=25808885}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whittle|first1=Patrick|display-authors=et al|date=12 Dec 2014|title=Re-creation tourism: de-extinction and its implications for nature-based recreation|journal=Current Issues in Tourism|volume=18|issue=10|pages=908–912|doi=10.1080/13683500.2015.1031727|s2cid=154878733}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prioritising de-extinction could lead to the improvement of current conservation strategies. Conservation measures would initially be necessary in order to reintroduce a species into the ecosystem, until the revived population can sustain itself in the wild.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.labroots.com/trending/plants-and-animals/5579/pros-cons-reviving-extinct-animal-species|last=Bouchard|first=Anthony|date=2017-03-20|title=The Pros and Cons of Reviving Extinct Animal Species {{!}} Plants And Animals|website=LabRoots|access-date=2020-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reintroduction of an extinct species could also help improve ecosystems that had been destroyed by human development. It may also be argued that reviving species driven to extinction by humans is an ethical obligation.&lt;ref name="Kasperbauer 1–14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kasperbauer|first=T. J.|date=2017-01-02|title=Should We Bring Back the Passenger Pigeon? The Ethics of De-Extinction|journal=Ethics, Policy &amp; Environment|volume=20|issue=1|pages=1–14|doi=10.1080/21550085.2017.1291831|s2cid=90369318|issn=2155-0085}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disadvantages of de-extinction ==
The reintroduction of extinct species could have a negative impact on existing species and their ecosystem. The extinct species' ecological niche may have been filled in its former habitat, thus making them an invasive species. This could lead to the extinction of other species due to competition for food or other [[Competitive exclusion principle|competitive exclusion]]. It could also lead to the extinction of prey species if they have more predators in an environment that had few predators before the reintroduction of an extinct species.&lt;ref name="Kasperbauer 1–14"/&gt; If a species has been extinct for a long period of time the environment they are introduced to could be wildly different from the one that they can survive in. The changes in the environment due to human development could mean that the species may not survive if reintroduced into that ecosystem.&lt;ref name="e360.yale.edu"/&gt; A species could also become extinct again after de-extinction if the reasons for its extinction are still a threat. The woolly mammoth might be hunted by poachers just like [[elephant]]s for their [[ivory]] and could go extinct again if this were to happen. Or, if a species is reintroduced into an environment with disease for which it has no immunity, the reintroduced species could be wiped out by a disease that current species can survive.

De-extinction is a very expensive process. Bringing back one species can cost millions of dollars. The money for de-extinction would most likely come from current conservation efforts. These efforts could be weakened if funding is taken from conservation and put into de-extinction. This would mean that [[critically endangered]] species would start to go extinct faster because there are no longer resources that are needed to maintain their populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://e360.yale.edu/features/the_case_against_de-extinction_its_a_fascinating_but_dumb_idea|title=The Case Against De-Extinction: It's a Fascinating but Dumb Idea|website=Yale Environment 360|last1=Ehrlich|first1=Paul|last2=Ehrlich|first2=Anne H.|date=2014-01-13|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, since cloning techniques cannot perfectly replicate a species as it existed in the wild, the reintroduction of the species may not bring about positive environmental benefits. They may not have the same role in the food chain that they did before and therefore cannot restore damaged ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Richmond|first1=Douglas J.|last2=Sinding|first2=Mikkel-Holger S.|last3=Gilbert|first3=M.

== Current candidate species for de-extinction ==
=== Aurochs ===
[[File:Taurus bull MBD.jpg|thumb|A bull from the Taurus Project, a project aiming to de-extinct the aurochs through back breeding modern domesticated cattle.]]
The [[aurochs]] (''Bos primigenius'') was widespread across Eurasia, North Africa, and the Indian subcontinent during the [[Pleistocene]], but only the European aurochs (''B. p. primigenius'') survived into historical times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite iucn |author=Tikhonov, A. |date=2008 |title=''Bos primigenius'' |volume=2008 |page=e.T136721A4332142 |doi=10.2305/IUCN.UK.2008.RLTS.T136721A4332142.en |access-date=12 November 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; This species is heavily featured in European cave paintings, such as [[Lascaux cave|Lascaux]] and [[Chauvet cave|Chauvet]] cave in France,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/life/Aurochs#p00fc2yh|title=BBC Nature – Cattle and aurochs videos, news and facts|website=bbc.co.uk|access-date=23 November 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140411091101/https://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/life/Aurochs#p00fc2yh|archive-date=2014-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was still widespread during the [[Roman era]]. Following the [[fall of the Roman Empire]], overhunting of the aurochs by nobility caused its population to dwindle to a single population in the [[Jaktorów]] forest in Poland, where the last wild one died in 1627.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rokosz |first1=Mieczyslaw |year=1995 |title=History of the aurochs (''Bos taurus primigenius'') in Poland |journal=Animal Genetic Resources Information |volume=16 |pages=5–12 |doi=10.1017/S1014233900004582}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, because the aurochs is ancestral to most modern [[cattle]] breeds, it is possible for it to be brought back through selective or back breeding. The first attempt at this was by [[Heinz Heck|Heinz]] and [[Lutz Heck]] using modern cattle breeds, which resulted in the creation of [[Heck cattle]]. This breed has been introduced to nature preserves across Europe; however, it differs strongly from the aurochs in physical characteristics, and some modern attempts claim to try to create an animal that is nearly identical to the aurochs in morphology, behavior, and even genetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lawson |first=Kristan |title='Jurassic farm' can bring prehistoric barnyard animals back from extinction |date=2014-09-10 |website=Modern Farmer |url=http://modernfarmer.com/2014/09/jurassic-farm-can-bring-prehistoric-barnyard-animals-back-extinction/ |url-status=dead |access-date=23 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150308174414/https://modernfarmer.com/2014/09/jurassic-farm-can-bring-prehistoric-barnyard-animals-back-extinction/|archive-date=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several projects that aim to create a cattle breed similar to the aurochs through selectively breeding primitive cattle breeds over a course of twenty years to create a self-sufficient bovine grazer in herds of at least 150 animals in rewilded nature areas across Europe, for example the [[Tauros Programme]] and the separate [[Taurus Project]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Pais, Bárbara |title=TaurOs Programme |website=Atnatureza.org |url=http://www.atnatureza.org/index.php/en/projects-hidder/2-uncategorised/125-programa-tauros-en |access-date=23 November 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006134425/http://www.atnatureza.org/index.php/en/projects-hidder/2-uncategorised/125-programa-tauros-en |archive-date=2014-10-06}}

A competing project to recreate the aurochs is the [[Uruz Project]] by the [[True Nature Foundation]], which aims to recreate the aurochs by a more efficient breeding strategy using [[genome editing]], in order to decrease the number of generations of breeding needed and the ability to quickly eliminate undesired traits from the population of aurochs-like cattle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Aurochs |website=True Nature Foundation (truenaturefoundation.org) |url=http://www.truenaturefoundation.org/wildlife/aurochs |url-status=dead |access-date=2015-07-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150116173809/http://www.truenaturefoundation.org/wildlife/aurochs |archive-date=2015-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is hoped that aurochs-like cattle will reinvigorate European nature by restoring its ecological role as a keystone species and bring back biodiversity that disappeared following the decline of European [[megafauna]], as well as helping to bring new economic opportunities related to European wildlife viewing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Aurochs: Born to be wild |website=Rewilding Europe (Rewildingeurope.com) |url=http://www.rewildingeurope.com/publications/the-aurochs-born-to-be-wild/ |access-date=23 November 2014 |archive-date=7 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507135555/https://www.rewildingeurope.com/publications/the-aurochs-born-to-be-wild/ |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dire wolf ===
{{main|Colossal Biosciences Dire Wolf Project}}

&lt;!-- The Dire wolf will remain here until more information comes out on the genetics of Colossal's animals and until their paper on updated phenology of the dire wolf finished. --&gt;&lt;!-- Do not add a "reception" section to this entry, as the opinions from independent experts and organisations are discussed in detail on the main articles. --&gt;There have been attempts to recreate the [[dire wolf]] (''Aenocyon dirus'') in modern times. The first is a project called the Dire Wolf Project, a project begun in 1988 that aims to revive the species through [[backbreeding]] of domestic dogs, similar to the [[Quagga Project|Quagga project]]. However, this project is not based in [[scientific method]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Find out about the Dire Wolf Project {{!}} Dire Wolf Project |url=https://direwolfproject.com/about-us/ |access-date=2025-04-07 |website=direwolfproject.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2025, it was announced that [[Colossal Biosciences]] used [[cloning]] and [[Genetic engineering|gene-editing]] to birth three genetically modified wolf pups with the characteristics of the dire wolf: six-month-old males Romulus and Remus and two-month-old female Khaleesi. In-house scientists at Colossal analyzed the dire wolf genome, extracted from two ancient samples – a 13,000-year-old tooth and a 72,000-year-old ear bone. After comparing the genomes of [[gray wolves]] and dire wolves to identify the genetic differences responsible for the dire wolf's distinctive features, Colossal made edits to the genetic code of the gray wolf to replicate those traits. Domestic dogs were used as surrogate mothers for the pups.&lt;ref name="Klinger"&gt;{{Cite magazine|url=https://time.com/7274542/colossal-dire-wolf/|author=Jeffrey Klinger|title=The Return of the Dire Wolf|date=April 7, 2025|magazine=Time|access-date=April 7, 2025|archive-date=April 7, 2025|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20250407144101/https://time.com/7274542/colossal-dire-wolf/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Max"&gt;{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/04/14/the-dire-wolf-is-back|author=D.

=== Dodo ===
[[File:Dodo 1.JPG|thumb|Model based on modern research at [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]]]]
The [[dodo]] (''Raphus cucullatus'') was a flightless bird endemic to the island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean. Due to various factors such as the inability to [[Fight-or-flight response|feel fear]] caused by isolation from significant predators, predation from humans and introduced invasive species such as pigs, dogs, cats, rats, and [[crab-eating macaque]]s, competition for food with invasive species, habitat loss, and the birds naturally slow reproduction, the species' numbers declined rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hume |first=Julian P. |title=Extinct birds |date=2017 |publisher=Christopher Helm |isbn=978-1-4729-3744-5 |edition=Second |location=London New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last widely accepted recorded sighting was in 1662.

=== Heath hen ===
[[File:AlfredOttoGross1.jpg|thumb|left|Ornithologist, professor [[Alfred Otto Gross]] holding Booming Ben, the last known heath hen ]]
The [[heath hen]] ''(Tympanuchus cupido cupido)'' was a subspecies of [[Greater prairie-chicken|greater prairie chicken]] endemic to the [[Pine barrens|heathland barrens]] of coastal North America.

The Indian cheetah was a population of the [[Asiatic cheetah]] (''Acinonyx jubatus venaticus'') that was endemic to India. The Asiatic cheetah was [[Local extinction|extirpated]] from the region due to trapping by Indian royalty to aid in [[coursing]] since the 16th century, and later poaching, habitat loss, and [[Coextinction|loss of prey]] in the 20th century, leading to being declared extinct by the Indian government in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;Divyabhanusinh (1999).

The [[Maclear's rat]] (''Rattus macleari''), also known as the Christmas Island rat, was a large rat endemic to Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean. It is believed Maclear's rat might have been responsible for keeping the population of [[Christmas Island red crab]] in check.

=== Passenger pigeon ===
[[File:Martha last passenger pigeon 1912.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Martha (passenger pigeon)|Martha]], the last known passenger pigeon]]
The [[passenger pigeon]] (''Ectopistes migratorius'') numbered in the billions before being wiped out due to unsustainable commercial hunting and habitat loss during the early 20th century. The non-profit [[Revive &amp; Restore]] obtained DNA from the passenger pigeon from museum specimens and skins; however, this DNA is degraded because it is so old. For this reason, simple cloning would not be an effective way to perform de-extinction for this species because parts of the genome would be missing. Instead, Revive &amp; Restore focuses on identifying mutations in the DNA that would cause a phenotypic difference between the extinct passenger pigeon and its closest living relative, the [[band-tailed pigeon]]. In doing this, they can determine how to modify the DNA of the band-tailed pigeon to change the traits to mimic the traits of the passenger pigeon. In this sense, the de-extinct passenger pigeon would not be genetically identical to the extinct passenger pigeon, but it would have the same traits. In 2015, the de-extinct passenger pigeon hybrid was forecast ready for captive breeding by 2025 and released into the wild by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Journal |first=Amy Dockser Marcus Wall Street |title=Passenger Pigeon Project Update |url=https://reviverestore.org/projects/the-great-passenger-pigeon-comeback/progress-to-date/ |access-date=2024-09-01 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2024, Revive &amp; Restore collaborated with Applied Ecological Institute to simulate forest disturbances in the American state of [[Wisconsin]] to see how trees would react to the reintroduced passenger pigeons. The original 2025 goal was not met, with the new goal for reviving the species for captive breeding set for between 2029 and 2032.

[[File:Quagga HIFI.jpg|thumb|Living quagga, 1870]]
The [[quagga]] (''Equus quagga quagga'') is a subspecies of the [[plains zebra]] that was distinct in that it was striped on its face and upper torso, but its rear abdomen was a solid brown. It was native to [[South Africa]], but was wiped out in the wild due to overhunting for sport, and the last individual died in 1883 in the Amsterdam Zoo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Equus_quagga/|last=Rodriguez|first=Debra L.|year=1999|title=''Equus quagga''|work=Animal Diversity Web|access-date=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since it is technically the same species as the surviving plains zebra, it has been argued that the quagga could be revived through artificial selection. The [[Quagga Project]] aims to breed a similar form of zebra by selective breeding of plains zebras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quaggaproject.org/quagga-objectives.htm|title=OBJECTIVES :: The Quagga Project :: South Africa|publisher=Quaggaproject.org|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141201150541/http://www.quaggaproject.org/quagga-objectives.htm|archive-date=1 December 2014|access-date=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is also known as back breeding. It also aims to release these animals onto the western Cape once an animal that fully resembles the quagga is achieved, which could have the benefit of eradicating [[introduced species]] of [[trees]] such as the [[Brazilian pepper tree]], ''[[Tipuana tipu]]'', ''[[Acacia saligna]]'', [[bugweed]], [[camphor tree]], [[stone pine]], [[cluster pine]], [[weeping willow]] and ''[[Acacia mearnsii]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Harley|first1=Eric H.|last2=Knight|first2=Michael H.|last3=Lardner|first3=Craig|last4=Wooding|first4=Bernard|last5=Gregor|first5=Michael|year=2009|title=The Quagga Project: Progress over 20 Years of Selective Breeding|journal=South African Journal of Wildlife Research|volume=39|issue=2|pages=155–163|citeseerx=10.1.1.653.4113|doi=10.3957/056.039.0206|s2cid=31506168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Steller's sea cow ===
[[File:The Model of Steller's sea cow (Hydrodamalis gigas).jpg|thumb|Model of Steller's sea cow]]
The [[Steller's sea cow]] was a [[sirenia]]n endemic to [[Bering Sea]] between Russia and the United States but had a much larger range during the [[Pleistocene]]. First described by [[Georg Wilhelm Steller]] in 1741, it was hunted to extinction 27 years later due to its [[buoyancy]] making it an easy target for humans hunting it for its meat and fur in addition to an already low population caused by climate change. In 2021, the nuclear genome of the species was sequenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Sharko |first1=Fedor S. |last2=Boulygina |first2=Eugenia S. |last3=Tsygankova |first3=Svetlana V. |last4=Slobodova |first4=Natalia V. |last5=Alekseev |first5=Dmitry A. |last6=Krasivskaya |first6=Anna A. |last7=Rastorguev |first7=Sergey M. |last8=Tikhonov |first8=Alexei N. |last9=Nedoluzhko |first9=Artem V. |date=2021-04-13 |title=Steller's sea cow genome suggests this species began going extinct before the arrival of Paleolithic humans |journal=Nature Communications |language=en |volume=12 |issue=1 |page=2215 |doi=10.1038/s41467-021-22567-5 |pmid=33850161 |issn=2041-1723|pmc=8044168 |bibcode=2021NatCo..12.2215S }}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2022, a group of Russian scientists funded by Sergei Bachin began their project to revive and reintroduce the giant sirenian to its former range in the 18th century to restore its kelp forest ecosystem.

=== Thylacine ===
[[File:"Benjamin".jpg|right|thumb|The last known thylacine died from neglect in the Hobart Zoo in 1936.]]
The [[thylacine]] (''Thylacinus cynocephalus''), commonly known as the Tasmanian tiger, was native to the [[Australian mainland]], [[Tasmania]] and [[New Guinea]]. It is believed to have become [[extinct]] in the 20th century. The thylacine had become extremely rare or extinct on the Australian mainland before [[History of Australia before 1901|British settlement]] of the continent. The last known thylacine died at the [[Hobart Zoo]], on September 7, 1936. It is believed to have died as the result of neglect—locked out of its sheltered sleeping quarters, it was exposed to a rare occurrence of extreme Tasmanian weather: [[heat wave|extreme heat]] during the day and freezing temperatures at night.&lt;ref name="P1952"&gt;[[#Paddle|Paddle (2000)]]{{Broken anchor|date=2024-05-27|bot=User:Cewbot/log/20201008/configuration|target_link=#Paddle|reason= }}, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Dunlevie |first1=James |date=5 December 2022 |title=Stop calling the last thylacine Benjamin, Tasmanian tiger researcher says |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-12-06/benjamin-thylacine-tasmanian-tiger-naming-myth-persists/101734442 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231216074150/https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-12-06/benjamin-thylacine-tasmanian-tiger-naming-myth-persists/101734442 |archive-date=Dec 16, 2023 |newspaper=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Official protection of the species by the Tasmanian government was introduced on July 10, 1936, roughly 59 days before the last known specimen died in captivity.&lt;ref name="TSD2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/threatened/ts-day/index.html|title=National Threatened Species Day|year=2006|publisher=Department of the Environment and Heritage, Australian Government|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709141827/http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/threatened/ts-day/index.html|archive-date=July 9, 2009|access-date=21 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, it was announced in the journal ''[[Nature Ecology and Evolution]]'' that the full nuclear genome of the thylacine had been successfully sequenced, marking the completion of the critical first step toward de-extinction that began in 2008, with the extraction of the DNA samples from the preserved pouch specimen.&lt;ref name="news.nationalgeographic.com2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/12/thylacine-genome-extinct-tasmanian-tiger-cloning-science/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171211203647/https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/12/thylacine-genome-extinct-tasmanian-tiger-cloning-science/|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 11, 2017|title=Tasmanian Tiger Genome May Be First Step Toward De-Extinction|date=2017-12-11|access-date=2018-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The thylacine genome was reconstructed by using the genome editing method.

In August 2022, the University of Melbourne and [[Colossal Biosciences]] announced a partnership to accelerate de-extinction of the thylacine via genetic modification of one of its closest living relatives, the [[fat-tailed dunnart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |title=Lab takes 'giant leap' toward thylacine de-extinction with Colossal genetic engineering technology partnership |date=2022-08-16 |url=https://www.unimelb.edu.au/newsroom/news/2022/august/lab-takes-giant-leap-toward-thylacine-de-extinction-with-colossal-genetic-engineering-technology-partnership2 |access-date=2022-08-16 |publisher=The University of Melbourne |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220816184227/https://www.unimelb.edu.au/newsroom/news/2022/august/lab-takes-giant-leap-toward-thylacine-de-extinction-with-colossal-genetic-engineering-technology-partnership2 |archive-date=2022-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2024, Colossal claimed to have reconstructed a 99.9% complete genome of the thylacine from a well-preserved skull estimated to be 110 years old;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=MSN |url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/most-complete-tasmanian-tiger-genome-yet-pieced-together-from-110-year-old-pickled-head/ar-AA1spMUf |access-date=2024-10-20 |website=www.msn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the data has not yet been published.&lt;ref name="lepage2024"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Le Page |first1=Michael |title=De-extinction company claims it has nearly complete thylacine genome |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2452196-de-extinction-company-claims-it-has-nearly-complete-thylacine-genome/ |access-date=26 January 2025 |publisher=New Scientist |date=17 October 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2025, Colossal Biosciences and University of Melbourne claimed to have developed an [[Artificial womb|artificial marsupial womb]] to further accelerate the de-extinction of thylacine and conservation for endangered marsupials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2025-01-15 |title=Thylacine De-Extinction Achieves Mid-Gestation Marsupial Embryo Development In Artificial Uterus |url=https://www.iflscience.com/thylacine-de-extinction-achieves-mid-gestation-marsupial-embryo-development-in-artificial-uterus-77640 |access-date=2025-01-23 |website=IFLScience |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Woolly mammoth ===
{{main|Revival of the woolly mammoth}}
[[File:Woolly mammoth model Royal BC Museum in Victoria.jpg|thumb|The woolly mammoth is a current prime candidate for de-extinction through cloning or genome editing.]]

The existence of preserved soft tissue remains and [[DNA]] from [[woolly mammoth]]s (''Mammuthus primigenius'') has led to the idea that the species could be recreated by scientific means. Two methods have been proposed to achieve this:

The first would be to use the cloning process;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.livescience.com/17386-woolly-mammoth-clone.html|author=Charles Q. Choi|date=December 8, 2011|title=Woolly Mammoths Could Be Cloned Someday, Scientist Says|work=Live Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, even the most intact mammoth samples have had little usable DNA because of their conditions of preservation. There is not enough DNA intact to guide the production of an embryo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2017/07/woolly-mammoths-extinction-cloning-genetics/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190911152945/https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2017/07/woolly-mammoths-extinction-cloning-genetics/|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 11, 2019|title=We Could Resurrect the Woolly Mammoth. Here's How.|last=Worrall|first=Simon|date=2017-07-09|website=National Geographic News|language=en|access-date=2020-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second method would involve [[artificially inseminating]] an elephant egg cell with preserved sperm of the mammoth. The resulting offspring would be a [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] of the mammoth and its closest living relative the [[Asian elephant]]. After several generations of cross-breeding these hybrids, an almost pure woolly mammoth could be produced. However, sperm cells of modern mammals are typically potent for up to 15 years after deep-freezing, which could hinder this method.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/welcome-pleistocene-park-russian-scientists-say-high-chance-cloning-woolly-mammoth/|title=Welcome to Pleistocene Park: Russian scientists say they have a 'high chance' of cloning a woolly mammoth|last=Treu|first=Zachary|date=2014-03-14|work=PBS NewsHour|access-date=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Whether the hybrid embryo would be carried through the two-year gestation is unknown; in one case, an Asian elephant and an African elephant produced a live calf named [[Motty]], but it died of defects at less than two weeks old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url= http://discovermagazine.com/1999/apr/cover | title= Cloning the Woolly Mammoth | first= R. | last= Stone | journal= Discover Magazine | year= 1999 | url-status= live | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140729032746/http://discovermagazine.com/1999/apr/cover | archivedate= 29 July 2014 | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, a Japanese team found usable DNA in the brains of mice that had been frozen for 16 years. They hope to use similar methods to find usable mammoth DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mammoth.psu.edu|title=Mammoth Genome Project|publisher=Pennsylvania State University|access-date=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Japanese scientists announced plans to clone mammoths within six years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2011/01/17/scientists-trying-to-clone-resurrect-extinct-mammoth/?hpt=T2|title=Scientists trying to clone, resurrect extinct mammoth|last=Lendon|first=B.|date=17 January 2011|access-date=22 May 2013|publisher=CNN|archive-date=14 May 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210514024919/https://news.blogs.cnn.com/2011/01/17/scientists-trying-to-clone-resurrect-extinct-mammoth/?hpt=T2|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, the Russian Association of Medical Anthropologists reported that blood recovered from a frozen mammoth carcass in 2013 would now provide a good opportunity for cloning the woolly mammoth.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Another way to create a living woolly mammoth would be to migrate genes from the mammoth genome into the genes of its closest living relative, the Asian elephant, to create hybridized animals with the notable adaptations that it had for living in a much colder environment than modern day elephants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/mammoth-elephant-hybrids-could-be-created-within-the-decade-should-they-be#:~:text=Don't%20expect%20pseudo%2Dmammoths,could%20take%20decades%20to%20establish.|author=Michael Greshko|date=September 13, 2021|title= Mammoth-elephant hybrids could be created within the decade. Should they be?|work=National Geographic}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is currently being done by a team led by Harvard geneticist [[George M. Church|George Church]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The team has made changes in the elephant genome with the genes that gave the woolly mammoth its cold-resistant blood, longer hair, and an extra layer of fat.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-plan-to-turn-elephants-into-woolly-mammoths-is-already-underway/|title=The Plan to Turn Elephants Into Woolly Mammoths Is Already Underway|last=Koebler|first=Jason|date=2014-05-21|work=Motherboard|access-date=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to geneticist Hendrik Poinar, a revived woolly mammoth or mammoth-elephant hybrid may find suitable habitat in the tundra and taiga forest ecozones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/hendrik_poinar_bring_back_the_woolly_mammoth|title=Hendrik Poinar: Bring back the woolly mammoth! - Talk Video - TED.com|author=Hendrik Poinar|date=30 May 2013 |publisher=Ted.com|access-date=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

George Church has hypothesized the positive effects of bringing back the extinct woolly mammoth would have on the environment, such as the potential for reversing some of the damage caused by [[global warming]].&lt;ref name=":023"&gt;Church, George. "George Church: De-Extinction Is a Good Idea." Scientific American, 1 Sept. 2013. Web. 13 Oct. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; He and his fellow researchers predict that mammoths would eat the dead grass allowing the sun to reach the spring grass; their weight would allow them to break through dense, insulating snow in order to let cold air reach the soil; and their characteristic of felling trees would increase the absorption of sunlight.&lt;ref name=":023" /&gt; In an editorial condemning de-extinction, ''[[Scientific American]]'' pointed out that the technologies involved could have secondary applications, specifically to help species on the verge of extinction regain their [[genetic diversity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-efforts-bring-extinct-species-back-from-dead-miss-point/|title=Why Efforts to Bring Extinct Species Back from the Dead Miss the Point|website=Scientific American|date=June 2013 |language=en|access-date=2021-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Further species considered for de-extinction ==
A "De-extinction Task Force" was established in April 2014 under the auspices of the [[IUCN Species Survival Commission|Species Survival Commission]] (SSC) and charged with drafting a set of Guiding Principles on Creating Proxies of Extinct Species for Conservation Benefit to position the IUCN SSC on the rapidly emerging technological feasibility of creating a proxy of an extinct species.&lt;ref&gt;IUCN SSC (2016). IUCN SSC Guiding principles on Creating Proxies of Extinct Species for Conservation Benefit. Version 1.0. Gland, Switzerland: IUCN Species Survival Commission&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- You MUST provide a high-quality source that specifically states desire to revive and rewild a species in order to list it. Species added with tabloid-like sources will be removed. --&gt;&lt;!-- Chickenosaurus or any other "dinosaurs" that are reverse-genetically engineered avians are not de-extinctions. --&gt;

===Avians===
* [[Dinornis|Giant moa]] – The tallest birds to have ever lived. Both the [[North Island giant moa|northern]] and [[South Island giant moa|southern]] species became extinct by 1500 due to overhunting by the [[Māori people|Māori]] in New Zealand.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;
* [[Elephant bird]] – The heaviest birds to have ever lived, the elephant birds were driven to extinction by the early colonization of [[Madagascar]].

[[File:Conuropsis carolinensis (Carolina parakeet).jpg|thumb|The Carolina parakeet is a prime candidate for de-extinction due to the genome already being sequenced]]
* [[Carolina parakeet]] - One of the few native [[parrot]]s to the United States, it was driven to extinction by destruction of its habitat, overhunting, competition from introduced honeybees, and persecution for crop damages and declared extinct following the death of its final known member, [[Incas (parakeet)|Incas]] in 1918. Hundreds of specimens with viable DNA still exist in museums around the world, making it a prime candidate for revival. In 2019, the full [[genome]] of the Carolina parakeet was sequenced.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Dodgson |first=Lindsay |title=25 animals that scientists want to bring back from extinction |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/animals-scientists-bring-back-de-extinction-2017-1 |access-date=2021-02-19 |website=Business Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Smith |first=Kiona N. |title=Scientists Sequenced The Genome Of The Carolina Parakeet, America's Extinct Native Parrot |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kionasmith/2019/12/13/scientists-sequenced-the-genome-of-the-carolina-parakeet-americas-extinct-native-parrot/ |access-date=2024-09-19 |website=Forbes |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Great auk]] - A flightless bird native to the [[North Atlantic]] physically similar to penguins. The great auk went extinct in the 1800s due to overhunting by humans for food. The last two known great auks lived on an island near Iceland and were clubbed to death by sailors. There have been no known sightings since.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2013-04-01|title=Bringing Them Back to Life|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/article/species-revival-bringing-back-extinct-animals|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210219193125/https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/article/species-revival-bringing-back-extinct-animals|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 19, 2021|access-date=2021-02-18|website=Magazine|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The great auk has been identified as a good candidate for de-extinction by Revive and Restore, a non-profit organization. Because the great auk is extinct it cannot be cloned, but its DNA can be used to alter the genome of its closest relative, the [[razorbill]], and breed the hybrids to create a species that will be very similar to the original great auks. The plan is to introduce them back into their original habitat, which they would then share with razorbills and [[puffins]], who are also at risk for extinction. This would help restore the biodiversity and restore that part of the ecosystem. Colossal Biosciences has also expressed interest in reviving the species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Can the great auk return from extinction? {{!}} Conservation {{!}} Earth Touch News|url=https://www.earthtouchnews.com/conservation/conservation/can-the-great-auk-return-from-extinction|access-date=2021-02-18|website=Earth Touch News Network|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

[[File:Huia Buller.jpg|thumb|The huia was one of the very first proposed candidates for de-extinction through cloning]]
* [[Huia]] – A species of [[Callaeidae]] native to New Zealand. It became extinct in 1907 due to overhunting from both the [[Māori people|Māori]] and European settlers, habitat loss, and predation from introduced invasive species. In 1999, students of [[Hastings Boys' High School]]  proposed the idea of de-extinction of the huia, the school's emblem through cloning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2008-06-12 |title=NZSM OnLine -- Ten years of New Zealand Science Monthly magazine |url=http://nzsm.webcentre.co.nz/article2371.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612131328/http://nzsm.webcentre.co.nz/article2371.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2008-06-12 |access-date=2024-08-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ngāti Huia]] tribe approved of the idea and the de-extinction process would have been performed by the [[University of Otago]] with $100,000 funding from a Californian-based internet startup.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dorey |first=Emma |date=1999-08-01 |title=Huia cloned back to life? |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt0899_736c |journal=Nature Biotechnology |language=en |volume=17 |issue=8 |pages=736 |doi=10.1038/11628 |pmid=10429272 |issn=1546-1696}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the poor state of DNA in the specimens at [[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa]], a complete huia genome could not be created, making this method of de-extinction improbable to succeed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2014-08-26 |title=The last huia - Health - Science - The Listener |url=http://www.listener.co.nz/current-affairs/science/the-last-huia/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826162224/http://www.listener.co.nz/current-affairs/science/the-last-huia/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2014-08-26 |access-date=2024-08-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The genus and family became extinct in 1987 following the extinction of its final living member, the [[Kauaʻi ʻōʻō]]. The reasons for the genus' decline were overhunting for their plumage, habitat loss caused by colonization of Hawaii, [[Hurricane Iwa|natural]] [[Hurricane Iniki|disasters]], mosquito-borne diseases, and predation from introduced invasive species.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Mammals===

* [[Pyrenean ibex]] – A subspecies of ibex that was native to the [[Pyrenees]], the subspecies was declared extinct in the early 2000 following the death of Celia, the endling of the subspecies after two centuries of overhunting and competition with livestock and introduced species. Celia was successfully cloned by Spanish scientists in 2003, but the clone died shortly after its birth due to a lung defect. 10 years later, The Aragon Hunting Federation in collaboration with ''CITA'' (Centre for Research and Food Technology of [[Aragon]]) began a second attempt to potentially revive the subspecies by verifying if Celia's frozen cells were still viable for future cloning attempts.

=== Floreana giant tortoise ===
The [[Floreana giant tortoise]] (''Chelonoidis niger niger'') is a subspecies of the [[Galápagos tortoise]] endemic to [[Floreana Island]], [[Ecuador]] that is believed to have become extinct by 1850 due to overexploitation, predation, and [[Habitat destruction|habitat degradation]] by sailors and invasive species such as [[Feral pig|feral]] [[Feral goat|livestock]], rodents, and [[Free-ranging dog|stray dogs]] and [[Feral cat|cats]]. A deliberate [[wildfire]] started by Thomas Chappel, a crew member of the [[Essex (whaleship)|Essex]] in 1820 is also cited as a reason for the subspecies initial decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Conrad |first=Cyler |title=Moby-Dick and the Galápagos Tortoises |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/moby-dick-and-the-galapagos-tortoises/ |access-date=2025-01-02 |website=Scientific American |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Floreana and [[Volcán Wolf giant tortoise|Volcán Wolf]] tortoise [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] were discovered [[Isabela Island (Galápagos)|Isabela Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Poulakakis |first1=N. |last2=Glaberman |first2=S. |last3=Russello |first3=M. |last4=Beheregaray |first4=L.

Some examples of technosignatures are described in [[Paul Davies]]'s 2010 book ''[[The Eerie Silence]]'', although the terms "technosignature" and "technomarker" do not appear in the book.

In February 2023, astronomers reported, after scanning 820 stars, the detection of 8 possible technosignatures for follow-up studies.&lt;ref name="NA-20221130"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ma, Peter Xiangyuan |display-authors=et al. |title=A deep-learning search for technosignatures of 820 nearby stars |url=https://seti.berkeley.edu/ml_gbt/MLSETI_NatAstron_arxiv3.pdf |date=30 November 2022  |journal=[[Nature Astronomy]] |accessdate=11 February 2023 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Dyson sphere]], constructed by life forms dwelling in proximity to a [[Solar analog|Sun-like star]], would cause an increase in the amount of infrared radiation in the star system's emitted spectrum.

Shkadov thrusters, with the hypothetical ability to change the orbital paths of stars in order to avoid various dangers to life such as [[molecular cloud|cold molecular cloud]]s or [[impact event|cometary impact]]s, would also be detectable in a similar fashion to the [[transit method|transiting]] extrasolar planets searched by ''Kepler''.

==Planetary analysis==

===Artificial heat and light===
[[File:Earth's City Lights by DMSP, 1994-1995 (large).jpg|thumb|250px|Lights from cities and infrastructure on Earth at night from space]]
Various astronomers, including [[Avi Loeb]] of the [[Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics]]. [[Edwin L. Turner]] of [[Princeton University]], and [[Thomas Beatty]] of the [[University_of_Wisconsin–Madison | University of Wisconsin]] have proposed that artificial light from extraterrestrial planets, such as that originating from cities, industries, and transport networks, could be detected and signal the presence of an advanced civilization. 

Light and heat detected from planets must be distinguished from natural sources to conclusively prove the existence of intelligent life on a planet.&lt;ref name=almar-2011 /&gt; For example, NASA's 2012 ''Black Marble'' experiment showed that significant stable light and heat sources on Earth, such as chronic wildfires in arid [[Western Australia]], originate from uninhabited areas and are naturally occurring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/NPP/news/aus-fires.html |title=Wildfires Light Up Western Australia |publisher=Nasa.gov |date=2012-12-07 |access-date=2013-07-10 |archive-date=2012-12-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121208151923/http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/NPP/news/aus-fires.html |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spectroscopic observations of exoplanet nightsides would be able to identify artificial lighting via its distinct spectroscopic signature. Work by astronomer [[Thomas Beatty]] has shown that the spectrally concentrated emission from [[Sodium-vapor_lamp|sodium street lights]] would be distinguishable from natural sources using proposed next generation space telescopes. The proposed [[Large Ultraviolet Optical Infrared Surveyor|LUVOIR A]] may be able to detect city lights twelve times those of Earth on [[Proxima b]] in 300 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Beatty |first1=Thomas G. |title=The Detectability of Nightside City Lights on Exoplanets |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |pages=2652–2662 |doi=10.1093/mnras/stac469 |date=6 May 2022|volume=513 |issue=2 |doi-access=free |arxiv=2105.09990 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that once extraterrestrials arrive "at a new home, such life will almost certainly create technosignatures (because it used technology to get there), and some fraction of them may also eventually give rise to a new biosphere".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wright |first1=Jason T. |last2=Haqq-Misra |first2=Jacob |last3=Frank |first3=Adam |last4=Kopparapu |first4=Ravi |last5=Lingam |first5=Manasvi |last6=Sheikh |first6=Sofia Z. |title=The Case for Technosignatures: Why They May Be Abundant, Long-lived, Highly Detectable, and Unambiguous |journal=The Astrophysical Journal Letters |date=1 March 2022 |volume=927 |issue=2 |pages=L30 |doi=10.3847/2041-8213/ac5824 |arxiv=2203.10899 |bibcode=2022ApJ...927L..30W |s2cid=247448627 |language=en |issn=2041-8205 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Microorganism DNA may have been used for self-replicating messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ellery |first1=Alex |title=Self-replicating probes are imminent – implications for SETI |journal=International Journal of Astrobiology |year=2022 |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=212–242 |doi=10.1017/S1473550422000234 |bibcode=2022IJAsB..21..212E |s2cid=250398136 |language=en |issn=1473-5504|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{additional citation needed|date=August 2022}} See also: [[DNA digital data storage]]

=== On exoplanets ===
Low- or high-albedo installations such as solar panels may also be detectable, albeit distinguishing artificial megastructures from high- and low-albedo natural environments (e.g., bright ice caps) may make it unfeasible.&lt;ref name="10.3847/1538-3881/ab2df3"/&gt;

==Scientific projects searching for technosignatures==

One of the first attempts to search for Dyson Spheres was made by Vyacheslav Slysh from the [[Russian Space Research Institute]] in Moscow in 1985 using data from the [[IRAS|Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21829112-100-alien-megaprojects-the-hunt-has-begun/|title=Alien megaprojects: The hunt has begun|last=Battersby|first=Stephen|author-link=Stephen Battersby (science journalist)|work=New Scientist|date=3 April 2013|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another search for technosignatures, {{circa|2001}}, involved an analysis of data from the [[Compton Gamma Ray Observatory]] for traces of anti-matter, which, besides one "intriguing spectrum probably not related to SETI", came up empty.&lt;ref name="harris-2001" /&gt;

In 2005, [[Fermilab]] had an ongoing survey for such spectra by analyzing data from IRAS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://home.fnal.gov/~carrigan/Infrared_Astronomy/Fermilab_search.htm| title=Fermilab Dyson Sphere search program| date=2006| access-date=2006-03-02| first=D.| last=Carrigan| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060306222359/http://home.fnal.gov/~carrigan/Infrared_Astronomy/Fermilab_search.htm| archive-date=2006-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Shostak |first=Seth |date=Spring 2009 |journal=Engineering &amp; Science |title=When Will We Find the Extraterrestrials? |volume=72 |number=1 |pages=12–21 |issn=0013-7812 |url=http://archive.seti.org/pdfs/Shostak-spring2009-EnS.pdf &lt;!-- permalink to official source with abstract &amp; alternate PDF link: http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechES:72.1.Extraterrestrials --&gt; |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415115307/http://archive.seti.org/pdfs/Shostak-spring2009-EnS.pdf |archive-date=2015-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Identifying one of the many infra-red sources as a Dyson Sphere would require improved techniques for discriminating between a Dyson Sphere and natural sources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Dyson_sphere ''Dyson sphere'' at Scholarpedia]&lt;/ref&gt; Fermilab discovered 17 potential "ambiguous" candidates of which four have been named "amusing but still questionable".&lt;ref name="Carrigan 2012"/&gt; Other searches also resulted in several candidates, which are, however, unconfirmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dick Carrigan |url=http://home.fnal.gov/~carrigan/infrared_astronomy/Other_searches.htm |title=Dyson Sphere Searches |publisher=Home.fnal.gov |date=2010-12-16 |access-date=2012-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2005 paper, Luc Arnold proposed a means of detecting planetary-sized artifacts from their distinctive transit light curve signature. He showed that such technosignature was within the reach of space missions aimed at detecting exoplanets by the [[transit method]], as were ''Corot'' or ''Kepler'' projects at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Arnold |first1=Luc F.

In 2012, a trio of astronomers led by Jason Wright started a two-year search for Dyson Spheres, aided by grants from the [[Templeton Foundation]].&lt;ref name="UT-2013" /&gt;

In 2013, Geoff Marcy received funding to use data from the [[Kepler Telescope]] to search for Dyson Spheres and interstellar communication using lasers,&lt;ref name="SMH-2013" /&gt; and [[Lucianne Walkowicz]] received funding to detect artificial signatures in stellar photometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://scienceblogs.com/catdynamics/2012/10/04/new-frontiers-in-astronomy-the-research-grant-winners/ | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022101358/http://scienceblogs.com/catdynamics/2012/10/04/new-frontiers-in-astronomy-the-research-grant-winners/ | archive-date=2013-10-22 | title=New Frontiers in Astronomy: The research grant winners &amp;#124; ScienceBlogs }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 2016, astronomer [[Jean-Luc Margot]] of [[UCLA]] has been searching for technosignatures with large radio telescopes.&lt;ref name="UT-2018" /&gt;

'''Technological determinism''' is a [[reductionism|reductionist]] [[theory]] in assuming that a society's [[technology]] progresses by following its own internal logic of [[efficiency]], while [[determinism|determining]] the development of the [[social structure]] and [[cultural values]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Héder|first=Mihály|title=AI and the resurrection of Technological Determinism|journal=Információs Társadalom (Information Society)|date=June 2021|volume=21|issue=2|pages=119–130|doi=10.22503/inftars.XXI.2021.2.8|s2cid=244186553 |url=https://inftars.infonia.hu/pub/inftars.XXI.2021.2.8.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is believed to have originated from [[Thorstein Veblen]] (1857–1929), an American [[sociologist]] and [[economist]]. The most radical technological determinist in the United States in the 20th century was most likely [[Clarence Ayres]] who was a follower of [[Thorstein Veblen]] as well as [[John Dewey]]. [[William Ogburn]] was also known for his radical technological determinism and his theory on [[cultural lag]].

== Origin ==
The origins of technological determinism as a formal concept are often traced to [[Thorstein Veblen]] (1857–1929), an influential American sociologist and economist. Veblen, known for his work on social and economic issues, introduced ideas that portrayed technology as a powerful, autonomous force capable of shaping [[Social norm|societal norms]] and structures. He argued that the development and use of machinery exerted an independent influence on human thought and behavior, notably asserting that "the machine throws out anthropomorphic habits of thought.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=The Culture of Technology |url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262660563/the-culture-of-technology/ |access-date=2024-10-29 |website=MIT Press |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Veblen |first=Thorstein |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=05goAAAAYAAJ |title=The Engineers and the Price System |date=1921 |publisher=B. W. Huebsch, Incorporated |isbn=978-0-670-29549-4 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This notion laid the foundation for technological determinism by suggesting that technology inherently transforms society by reshaping patterns of [[thought]] and [[behavior]].

=== Historical Context and Influences ===
During Veblen's time, rapid [[Industrialisation|industrialization]] and advancements in technology were radically altering [[Society of the United States|American society]]. Innovations in [[manufacturing]] and [[transport]]ation, such as the [[assembly line]] and [[Rail transport|railroads]], demonstrated technology’s potential to reshape economic and social structures. These changes helped popularize the idea that technology could independently drive [[Sociocultural evolution|societal evolution]], creating the conditions for Veblen's ideas to resonate widely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Marx |first=Leo |date=1997 |title="Technology": The Emergence of a Hazardous Concept |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/40971194 |journal=Social Research |volume=64 |issue=3 |pages=965–988 |jstor=40971194 |issn=0037-783X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Influence of Karl Marx and Expansion by Clarence Ayres ===
Although Veblen is credited with coining the core ideas behind technological determinism, the influence of [[Karl Marx]] on these ideas is also significant. Marx argued that technology drives historical change by shaping the "material base" of society. For instance, he suggested that the railway in [[colonial India]] would challenge and erode the [[Caste|caste system]] by introducing new economic activities and altering social hierarchies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Manifesto of the Communist Party |url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ |access-date=2024-10-29 |website=www.marxists.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Avineri |first=Shlomo |url=https://archive.org/details/socialpoliticalt0000avin/mode/2up |title=The social and political thought of Karl Marx / by Shlomo Avineri |date=1968 |publisher=London; New York : Cambridge at the University Press |others=Internet Archive |isbn=978-0-521-04071-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[Clarence Ayres]], a 20th-century economist inspired by Veblen, expanded on these ideas by introducing the concept of "technological drag." According to Ayres, technology progresses as a dynamic, self-generating force, while traditional institutions often lag, resisting the transformative potential of technological change. Ayres’ theory further solidified technological determinism, emphasizing the inevitable clash between technological progress and [[social conservatism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Clarence Edwin Ayres |url=https://archive.org/details/theoryofeconomic0000clar |title=The theory of economic progress |date=1944-01-01 |publisher=The University of North Carolina Press |others=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Journal of Economic Issues, Taylor &amp; Francis Journals {{!}} IDEAS/RePEc |url=https://ideas.repec.org/s/mes/jeciss.html |access-date=2024-10-29 |website=ideas.repec.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Explanation ==
{{more citations needed section|date=February 2023}}
Technological determinism seeks to show technical developments, media, or technology as a whole, as the key mover in history and social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kunz|first=William M.|title=Culture Conglomerates: Consolidation in the Motion Picture and Television Industries|year=2006|publisher=Publisher: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc.|isbn=978-0742540668|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a theory subscribed to by "hyperglobalists" who claim that as a consequence of the wide availability of technology, accelerated globalization is inevitable. Therefore, technological development and innovation become the principal motor of social, economic or political change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Global politics|date=2015|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9781137349262|oclc=979008143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strict adherents to technological determinism do not believe the influence of technology differs based on how much a technology is or can be used. Instead of considering technology as part of a larger spectrum of human activity, technological determinism sees technology as the basis for all human activity.

Technological determinism has been summarized as 'The belief in technology as a key governing force in society ...' ([[Merritt Roe Smith]]). 'The idea that technological development determines social change ...' (Bruce Bimber). It changes the way people think and how they interact with others and can be described as '...a three-word logical proposition: "Technology determines history"' ([[Rosalind H. Williams]]) &lt;!--[thanks to Brian Martin: http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/pubs/96BRmetascience.html"].--&gt;. It is, '... the belief that social progress is driven by technological innovation, which in turn follows an "inevitable" course.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/28929481|title=Does technology drive history? : the dilemma of technological determinism|date=1994|publisher=MIT Press|others=Merritt Roe Smith, Leo Marx|isbn=0-262-19347-7|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=28929481}}&lt;/ref&gt; This 'idea of progress' or 'doctrine of progress' is centralized around the idea that social problems can be solved by technological advancement, and this is the way that society moves forward. Technological determinists believe that "'You can't stop progress', implying that we are unable to control technology" ([[Lelia Green]]). This suggests that we are somewhat powerless, and society allows technology to drive social changes because "societies fail to be aware of the alternatives to the values embedded in it [technology]" ([[Merritt Roe Smith]]).

Technological determinism has been defined as an approach that identifies technology, or technological advances, as the central causal element in processes of social change.&lt;ref&gt;(Croteau and Hoynes)&lt;/ref&gt; As technology is stabilized, its design tends to dictate users' behaviors, consequently stating that "technological progress equals social progress."&lt;ref name="ds.amu.edu.et"&gt;Wyatt, Sally. 2008. "Technological Determinism Is Dead; Long Live Technological Determinism." In The Handbook of Science and Technology Studies, edited by Edward Hackett, Olga Amsterdamska, Michael Lynch, and Lucy Wajcman, 165–80. Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press. https://ds.amu.edu.et/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/1114/00349.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y#page=181.&lt;/ref&gt; Key notions of this theory are separated into two parts, with the first being that the development of the technology itself may also be separate from social and political factors, arising from "the ways of inventors, engineers, and designers following an internal, technical logic that has nothing to do with social relationships".&lt;ref name="ds.amu.edu.et"/&gt; The second is that as technology is stabilized, its design tends to dictate users' behaviors, consequently resulting in social change.

As technology changes, the ways in which it is utilized and incorporated into the daily lives of individuals within a culture consequently affect the ways of living, highlighting how technology ultimately determines societal growth through its influence on relations and ways of living within a culture. To illustrate, "the invention of the wheel revolutionized human mobility, allowing humans to travel greater distances and carry greater loads with them".&lt;ref&gt;Drew, Chris. 2021. "Technological Determinism Theory (5 Examples, Pros &amp; Cons)." Helpfulprofessor.com. October 28, 2021. https://helpfulprofessor.com/technological-determinism-theory/.&lt;/ref&gt; This technological advancement also leads to interactions between different cultural groups, advanced trade, and thus impacts the size and relations both within and between different networks. Other examples include the invention of language, expanding modes of communication between individuals, the introduction of bookkeeping and written documentation, impacting the circulation of knowledge, and having streamlined effects on the socioeconomic and political systems as a whole. As Dusek (2006) notes, "culture and society cannot affect the direction of technology…[and] as technology develops and changes, the institutions in the rest of society change, as does the art and religion of a society."&lt;ref&gt;Dusek, Val. 2006. Philosophy of Technology : An Introduction. Malden, Ma; Oxford: Blackwell Pub.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, technological determinism dictates that technological advances and social relations are inevitably tied, with the change of either affecting the other by consequence of normalization.&lt;ref name="opentextbooks.clemson.edu"&gt;Salsone, Belle, Peter Sebastian Stein, Kaleb Gage Parsons, Thomas Kent, Krystal Nielsen, and David Thomas Nitz. 2020. "Technological Determinism." Opentextbooks.clemson.edu, July. https://opentextbooks.clemson.edu/sciencetechnologyandsociety/chapter/technological-determinism/.&lt;/ref&gt;

This stance however ignores the social and cultural circumstances in which the technology was developed. Sociologist Claude Fischer (1992) characterized the most prominent forms of technological determinism as "billiard ball" approaches, in which technology is seen as an external force introduced into a social situation, producing a series of ricochet effects.&lt;ref&gt;Croteau and Hoynes, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than acknowledging that a society or culture interacts with and even shapes the technologies that are used, a technological determinist view holds that "the uses made of technology are largely determined by the structure of the technology itself, that is, that its functions follow from its form" ([[Neil Postman]]).  However, this is not the sole view of TD following Smith and Marx's (1998)&lt;ref name="doi.org"&gt;Wengenroth, Ulrich, Merritt Roe Smith, and Leo Marx. 1998. "Does Technology Drive History? The Dilemma of Technological Determinism." Technology and Culture 39 (4): 755. https://doi.org/10.2307/1215849.&lt;/ref&gt; notion of "hard" determinism, which states that once a technology is introduced into a culture what follows is the inevitable development of that technology. In this view, the role of "agency (the power to affect change) is imputed on the technology itself, or some of its intrinsic attributes; thus the invention of technology leads to a situation of inescapable necessity."

The other view follows what Smith and Marx (1998)&lt;ref name="doi.org"/&gt; dictate as "soft" determinism, where the development of technology is also dependent on social context, affecting how it is adopted into a culture, "and, if the technology is adopted, the social context will have important effects on how the technology is used and thus on its ultimate impact".&lt;ref name="opentextbooks.clemson.edu"/&gt;

For example, we could examine the spread of mass-produced knowledge through the role of the printing press in the Protestant Reformation. Because of the urgency from the protestant side to get the reform off the ground before the church could react, "early Lutheran leaders, led by Luther himself, wrote thousands of anti-papal pamphlets in the Reformation's first decades and these works spread rapidly through reprinting in various print shops throughout central Europe".&lt;ref&gt;Boerner, Lars, Jared Rubin, and Battista Severgnini. 2021. "A Time to Print, a Time to Reform." European Economic Review 138 (September): 103826. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euroecorev.2021.103826.&lt;/ref&gt; As such the urgency of the socio-political context to utilize such technology in the beginning of its invention caused its fast adoption and normalization into European culture. We could view its uses in its popularization – for political propaganda purposes – in line with the continued traditions of newspapers in modern times, as well as newly adopted uses for other printed text, adapting to change in a social context such as an emphasis on leisurely activities such as reading.  This follows the soft deterministic view because the technological invention – the printing press – was quickly adopted because of the socio-political context, and because of its fast integration into society, has impacted and continues to impact how society operates.

== Hard and soft determinism ==
{{more citations needed section|date=February 2023}}

In examining [[determinism]], “hard determinism” can be contrasted with “soft determinism”. A [[compatibilist]] says that it is possible for [[free will]] and determinism to exist in the world together, while an [[incompatibilist]] would say that they cannot and there must be one or the other. Those who support [[determinism]] can be further divided.

“Hard determinists” would view technology as developing independent from social concerns. They would say that technology creates a set of powerful forces acting to regulate our social activity and its meaning. According to this view of determinism we organize ourselves to meet the needs of technology, and the outcome of this organization is beyond our control or we do not have the freedom to make a choice regarding the outcome (autonomous technology). The 20th century French philosopher and social theorist [[Jacques Ellul]] could be said to be a hard determinist and proponent of autonomous technique (technology). In his 1954 work ''[[:fr:La Technique ou l'Enjeu du siècle|The Technological Society]]'', Ellul essentially posits that technology, by virtue of its power through efficiency, determines which social aspects are best suited for its own development through a process of natural selection. A social system's values, morals, philosophy etc. that are most conducive to the advancement of technology allow that social system to enhance its power and spread at the expense of those social systems whose values, morals, philosophy etc. are less promoting of technology. While geography, climate, and other "natural" factors largely determined the parameters of social conditions for most of human history, technology has recently become the dominant objective factor (largely due to forces unleashed by the industrial revolution) and it has been the principal objective and determining factor.

“Soft determinism”, as the name suggests, is a more passive view of the way technology interacts with socio-political situations. Soft determinists still subscribe to the fact that technology is the guiding force in our evolution but would maintain that we have a ''chance'' to make decisions regarding the outcomes of a situation. This is not to say that free will exists, but that the possibility for us to ''roll the dice'' and see what the outcome exists. A slightly different variant of soft determinism is the 1922 technology-driven theory of social change proposed by [[William Fielding Ogburn]], in which society must adjust to the consequences of major inventions, but often does so only after a period of [[cultural lag]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dafoe |first=Allan |date=2015 |title=On Technological Determinism: A Typology, Scope Conditions, and a Mechanism |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/43671266 |journal=Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values |volume=40 |issue=6 |pages=1047–1076 |doi=10.1177/0162243915579283 |jstor=43671266 |issn=0162-2439}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- This section needs a reference --&gt;

== Criticism ==
[[Skepticism]] about technological determinism emerged alongside increased [[pessimism]] about techno-science in the mid-20th century, in particular around the use of [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]] in the production of [[nuclear weapons]], [[Nazi human experimentation]] during [[World War II]], and the problems of economic development in the [[Third World]]. As a direct consequence, desire for greater control of the course of development of technology gave rise to disenchantment with the model of technological determinism in academia.

Modern theorists of technology and society no longer consider technological determinism to be a very accurate view of the way in which we interact with technology, even though determinist assumptions and language fairly saturate the writings of many boosters of technology, the business pages of many popular magazines, and much reporting on technology {{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}. Instead, research in [[science and technology studies]], [[social construction of technology]] and related fields have emphasized more nuanced views that resist easy causal formulations. They emphasize that "The relationship between technology and society cannot be reduced to a simplistic cause-and-effect formula. It is, rather, an 'intertwining'", whereby technology does not determine but "operates, and are operated upon in a complex social field" (Murphie and Potts).

T. Snyder approached the aspect of technological determinism in his concept: 'politics of inevitability'.&lt;ref&gt;The road to unfreedom, Snyder, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; A concept utilized by politicians in which society is promised the idea that the future will be only more of the present, this concept removes responsibility. This could be applied to free markets, the development of nation states and technological progress.

In his article "Subversive Rationalization: Technology, Power and Democracy with Technology," [[Andrew Feenberg]] argues that technological determinism is not a very well founded concept by illustrating that two of the founding theses of determinism are easily questionable and in doing so calls for what he calls [[democratic rationalization]] ([[Feenberg]] 210–212).

Prominent opposition to technologically determinist thinking has emerged within work on the [[social construction of technology]] (SCOT). SCOT research, such as that of Mackenzie and Wajcman (1997) argues that the path of innovation and its social consequences are strongly, if not entirely shaped by society itself through the influence of culture, politics, economic arrangements, regulatory mechanisms and the like. In its strongest form, verging on [[social determinism]], "What matters is not the technology itself, but the social or economic system in which it is embedded" ([[Langdon Winner]]).

In his influential but contested (see Woolgar and Cooper, 1999) article "Do Artifacts Have Politics?", [[Langdon Winner]] illustrates not a form of determinism but the various sources of the politics of technologies. Those politics can stem from the intentions of the designer and the culture of the society in which a technology emerges or can stem from the technology itself, a "practical necessity" for it to function. For instance, New York City urban planner [[Robert Moses]] is purported to have built Long Island's parkway tunnels too low for buses to pass in order to keep minorities away from the island's beaches, an example of externally inscribed politics. On the other hand, an authoritarian command-and-control structure is a practical necessity of a nuclear power plant if radioactive waste is not to fall into the wrong hands. As such, Winner neither succumbs to technological determinism nor social determinism. The source of a technology's politics is determined only by carefully examining its features and history.

Although "The deterministic model of technology is widely propagated in society" (Sarah Miller), it has also been widely questioned by scholars. [[Lelia Green]] explains that, "When technology was perceived as being outside society, it made sense to talk about technology as neutral". Yet, this idea fails to take into account that culture is not fixed and society is dynamic. When "Technology is implicated in social processes, there is nothing neutral about society" ([[Lelia Green]]). This confirms one of the major problems with "technological determinism and the resulting denial of human responsibility for change. There is a loss of human involvement that shape technology and society" (Sarah Miller).

Another conflicting idea is that of [[technological somnambulism]], a term coined by Winner in his essay "Technology as Forms of Life". Winner wonders whether or not we are simply ''sleepwalking'' through our existence with little concern or knowledge as to how we truly interact with technology. In this view, it is still possible for us to wake up and once again take control of the direction in which we are traveling (Winner 104). However, it requires society to adopt [[Ralph Schroeder (technology researcher)|Ralph Schroeder]]'s claim that, "users don't just passively consume technology, but actively transform it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schroeder |first1=Ralph |title=Rethinking Science, Technology, and Social Change |date=2007 |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=9780804755887 |page=99 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m7jaAAAAMAAJ |access-date=29 April 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In opposition to technological determinism are those who subscribe to the belief of [[social determinism]] and [[postmodernism]]. Social determinists believe that social circumstances alone select which technologies are adopted, with the result that no technology can be considered "inevitable" solely on its own merits. Technology and culture are not neutral and when knowledge comes into the equation, technology becomes implicated in social processes. The knowledge of how to create, enhance, and use technology is socially bound knowledge. Postmodernists take another view, suggesting that what is right or wrong is dependent on circumstance. They believe technological change can have implications on the past, present and future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Green|first=Leila|year=2001|title=Technoculture: From Alphabet to Cybersex|url=https://archive.org/details/technoculturefro00gree|url-access=limited|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|location=Crows Nest|page=[https://archive.org/details/technoculturefro00gree/page/n48 15]|isbn=9781865080482}}&lt;/ref&gt; While they believe technological change is influenced by changes in government policy, society and culture, they consider the notion of change to be a paradox, since change is constant.

Media and cultural studies theorist [[Brian Winston]], in response to technological determinism, developed a model for the emergence of new technologies which is centered on the [[Law of the suppression of radical potential]]. In two of his books – ''Technologies of Seeing: Photography, Cinematography and Television'' (1997) and ''Media Technology and Society'' (1998) – Winston applied this model to show how technologies evolve over time, and how their 'invention' is mediated and controlled by society and societal factors which suppress the radical potential of a given technology.

==Notable technological determinists ==

Some interpret [[Karl Marx]] as advocating technological determinism, with such statements as "The Handmill gives you society with the feudal lord: the [[steam-mill]], society with the industrial capitalist" (''The Poverty of Philosophy,'' 1847), but others argue that Marx was not a determinist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/tecdet/tdet02.html Technological or Media Determinism], Daniel Chandler&lt;/ref&gt;

Technological determinist [[Walter J. Ong]] reviews the societal transition from an oral culture to a written culture in his work ''Orality and Literacy: The Technologizing of the Word'' (1982). He asserts that this particular development is attributable to the use of new technologies of literacy (particularly print and writing,) to communicate thoughts which could previously only be verbalized. He furthers this argument by claiming that writing is purely context dependent as it is a "secondary modelling system" (8). Reliant upon the earlier primary system of spoken language, writing manipulates the potential of language as it depends purely upon the visual sense to communicate the intended information. Furthermore, the rather stagnant technology of literacy distinctly limits the usage and influence of knowledge, it unquestionably effects the evolution of society. In fact, Ong asserts that "more than any other single invention, writing has transformed human consciousness" (Ong 1982: 78).

== Media determinism as a form of technological determinism ==

Media determinism is a form of technological determinism, a philosophical and sociological position which posits the power of the media to impact society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.regent.edu/acad/schcom/rojc/mdic/define.html ''Media Determinism in Cyberspace''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529115801/http://www.regent.edu/acad/schcom/rojc/mdic/define.html |date=2010-05-29 }}, Regent University&lt;/ref&gt; Two foundational media determinists are the Canadian scholars [[Harold Innis]] and [[Marshall McLuhan]]. One of the best examples of technological determinism in media theory is Marshall McLuhan's theory "[[the medium is the message]]" and the ideas of his mentor Harold Adams Innis. Both these Canadian theorists saw media as the essence of civilization. The association of different media with particular mental consequences by McLuhan and others can be seen as related to technological determinism. It is this variety of determinism that is referred to as media determinism. According to McLuhan, there is an association between communications media/technology and language; similarly, [[Benjamin Lee Whorf]] argues that language shapes our perception of thinking ([[linguistic determinism]]). For McLuhan, media is a more powerful and explicit determinant than is the more general concept of language. McLuhan was not necessarily a hard determinist. As a more moderate version of media determinism, he proposed that our use of particular media may have subtle influences on us, but more importantly, it is the social context of use that is crucial.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://beforebefore.net/80f/s11/media/mcluhan.pdf |last=McLuhan|first=Marshall | title=Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324065603/http://beforebefore.net/80f/s11/media/mcluhan.pdf|archive-date= March 24, 2012|url-status= dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Media ecology]].
Media determinism is a form of the popular dominant theory of the relationship between [[technology and society]]. In a determinist view, technology takes on an active life of its own and is seen be as a driver of social phenomena. Innis believed that the social, cultural, political, and economic developments of each historical period can be related directly to the technology of the means of mass communication of that period. In this sense, like Dr. Frankenstein's monster, technology itself appears to be alive, or at least capable of shaping human behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/1789051 |last=Hist|first=Martin |title= One tweet does not a revolution make: Technological determinism, media and social change|publisher= Deakin University}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has been increasingly subject to critical review by scholars. For example, scholar [[Raymond Williams]], criticizes media determinism and rather believes social movements define technological and media processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Williams|first=Raymond |title=Television: Technology and Cultural Form|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PXSLD8j0kb8C&amp;q=Determination+is+a+real+social+process,+but+never&amp;pg=PA133 |access-date=28 May 2013 |year=1974 |publisher=Routledge |location=London and New York |isbn=978-0-415-31456-5 |page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to communications media, audience determinism is a viewpoint opposed to media determinism. This is described as instead of media being presented as doing things to people; the stress is on the way people do things with media. Individuals need to be aware that the term "deterministic" is a negative one for many social scientists and modern sociologists; in particular they often use the word as a term of abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/tecdet/tecdet.html |last=Chandler| first= Daniel | title=Technological or Media Determinism |date=18 September 1995|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150421235047/http://visual-memory.co.uk/daniel/Documents/tecdet/tecdet.html|archive-date=April 21, 2015 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Product ecosystem theory''' is an emerging theory that describes how the design of [[Durable goods|manufactured products]] evolves over time and draws parallels with how [[species]] evolve within a natural [[ecosystem]]. Fundamental to this theory is that [[manufactured product]] lines respond to external threats and opportunities in much the same way that species respond to threats and opportunities. Competition and other environmental pressures may cause a species to become extinct. An example of the parallel in [[Durable goods|consumer products]] is the way in which the typewriter became displaced (or extinct) due to pressures from the personal computer. 
Products lines can be seen to incrementally change and branch over time following the principle of [[phyletic gradualism]]. Or they can be seen to have periods of stasis followed by disruptive innovation. This follows the principle of [[punctuated equilibrium]].

Ecosystem Theory provides a conceptual framework that helps designers and others understand the mechanisms underpinning product innovation in a tangible and visual way. 
 
Technology change is one of the environmental variables that provide both opportunity and threat for products in much the same way that environmental variables such as climate provide opportunity and threat for species.
Evaluating designed products from this perspective is useful as it shows that the value of a product is not contained entirely within the product itself. Value is also obtained from the rest of the ecosystem.

== History and usage of the term ==

The term was first used in this context by Tim Williams in 2013 in a paper he wrote with Marianella Chamorro-Koc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Tim|last2=Chamorro-Koc|first2=Marianella|title=Product ecosystems: an emerging methodological approach to study the implementation of disruptive innovations: the case of the CityCar.|journal=Consilience and Innovation in Design: Proceedings and Program: 5th IASDR 2013 Tokyo Shibaura Institute of Technology.|date=2013|pages=1286–1295|publisher=5th International Congress of IASDR 2013|location=[Shuppanchi fumei]|isbn=978-4-9980776-3-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This paper proposed a methodology for understanding the difficulties of implementation for disruptive innovation based on a case study of the [[CityCar|MIT City Car]]. The term has been used non-specifically prior to this on a number of occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhou|first1=Feng|journal=Research in Engineering Design|date=2010|volume=22|issue=1|pages=43–61|doi=10.1007/s00163-010-0096-z|title=Fundamentals of product ecosystem design for user experience}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tobias|first1=Jim|title=Accessibility and Product Ecosystems|journal=The Information Society|date=26 April 2007|volume=23|issue=3|pages=183–186|doi=10.1080/01972240701323598}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Armano|first1=David|title=Building responsive and resilient brands in a connected world|url=http://darmano.typepad.com/logic_emotion/|website=Logic and Emotion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Electromagnetically-enhanced Physical Vapor Deposition (EPVD)''' is coating technique developed by Paradigm Shift Technologies, Inc.  which uses electromagnetic fields to improve traditional [[physical vapor deposition]], particularly in high-stress applications like gun barrel coatings.&lt;ref name="theglobeandmail.com"&gt;{{Cite news |date=2024-04-21 |title=European defence industry eyes Canadian technology |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-european-defence-industry-eyes-canadian-technology/ |access-date=2024-09-30 |work=The Globe and Mail |language=en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Toxic artillery: Paradigm Shift Technologies on chrome plating |url=https://defence.nridigital.com/global_defence_technology_jun24/toxic_artillery_paradigm_shift_technologies_on_chrome_plating |access-date=30 September 2024 |website=defence.nridigital.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
EPVD technology was developed by Paradigm Shift Technologies, Inc., a Canadian company founded in 1995. It was invented to replace the traditional [[chrome plating]].&lt;ref name="theglobeandmail.com"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

EPVD enhances the standard PVD process by utilizing electromagnetic fields to guide the deposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Advanced Gun Barrel Technologies (AGBT |url=https://ndiastorage.blob.core.usgovcloudapi.net/ndia/2010/armament/WednesdayLandmarkABillVezina.pdf |access-date=30 September 2024 |website=ndiastorage.blob}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process overview ==
EPVD involves vaporizing the coating material in vacuum and depositing it onto the substrate. [[Electromagnetic field|Electromagnetic fields]] are applied to control the deposition rate and ensure uniform coating thickness, resulting in superior coating properties.&lt;ref name="theglobeandmail.com"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In this process, the material is removed from a target made from the [[Refractory metals|refractory alloy]] and deposited on the bore of the gun barrel in a low-pressure, inert environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent|number=20060207871|title=Sputtering devices and methods|gdate=2006-09-21|invent1=Yumshtyk|invent2=Ivanov|inventor1-first=Gennady|inventor2-first=Dmitri|url=https://www.freepatentsonline.com/y2006/0207871.html#google_vignette}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent|number=CA2362146C|title=Procede et appareil de pulverisation au magnetron|gdate=2008-02-12|invent1=Yumshtyk|invent2=Ioumchtyk|inventor1-first=Gennady|inventor2-first=Michael|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/CA2362146C/fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists use it to create 3D images and videos of moving skeletal systems in living organisms.&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite web|url=https://biomedcorefacilities.brown.edu/xromm-facility|publisher=Brown University|accessdate=November 15, 2022|title=X-Ray Reconstruction of Moving Morphology (XROMM) Facility}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In XROMM, radio-opaque bone markers are implanted inside a living organism, which allows the X-ray video system to calculate accurate bone marker coordinates as the organism moves.

XROMM was invented at [[Brown University]].&lt;ref name=Brown /&gt;&lt;ref name=XR&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.xromm.org/history/|accessdate=November 15, 2022|publisher=Xromm.org|title=History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is shaped like a backpack and glued onto the back of a bat or other small animal. It contains [[GPS]] and wireless internet equipment that allow the scientists track the animal's movements.&lt;ref name="Eureka"&gt;{{cite news|title=Scientists develop 'backpack' computers to track wild animals in hard-to-reach habitats |url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-04/osu-sd040120.php|date=April 2, 2020|access-date=April 4, 2020|publisher=Eurekalert|author=Ohio State University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SciTimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.sciencetimes.com/articles/25198/20200403/fingertip-size-backpack-computers-used-track-tiny-animals-social-behavior.htm|title=Fingertip-size "Backpack" Computers Used to Track Tiny Animal's Social Behavior|date=April 3, 2020|access-date=April 7, 2020|publisher=Science Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientists who invented BATS differentiate it from other systems because it is lighter, requires less power, and can track animals even inside caves or hollow trees.&lt;ref name="PLOS"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000655

BATS falls off the animal's back after about fourteen days.  Scientists then collect fallen BATS to reuse the parts.

Scientists have used BATS to show that [[vampire bat]]s form social bonds when being kept by humans that they remember after being released.&lt;ref name="Eureka" /&gt;

==Name==

Scientists named the tool "broadly applicable tracking system" because they believe it can be used in a broad range of animals: bats, rodents, amphibians and reptiles.&lt;ref name="Eureka" /&gt; As of April 2020, BATS has only been used on bats.

==Invention==

The team that invented BATS includes scientists from the Museum of Natural History in [[Berlin]] and universities in [[Germany]] and [[Ohio State University]].

{{Orphan|date=February 2025}}

'''Gigabit Multimedia Serial Link''', commonly referred to as GMSL, is a serial link technology that is used for video distribution in cars. It was developed by [[Maxim Integrated]]. Maxim Integrated was acquired by [[Analog Devices]]&lt;ref name="matheus"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Matheus |first1=Kirsten |title=Automotive High Speed Communication Technologies |last2=Kaindl |first2=Michael |publisher=Carl Hanser Verlag |year=2023 |isbn=978-3-446-46918-1 |location=Munich, Germany |pages=207–210 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Terzis |first=Anestis |title=Handbook of Camera Monitor Systems, The Automotive Mirror-Replacement Technology based on ISO 16505 |publisher=[[Springer Publishing Company|Springer]] |year=2016 |isbn=978-3-319-29609-8 |location=Switzerland |pages=279–280 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Maxim Integrated|2021]].

GMSL is an asymmetric, [[full duplex]] [[SerDes]] technology - which means that it transports data at a high rate in the [[downlink]] (or forward) direction, while simultaneously transporting a lower data rate in the [[uplink]] (or reverse) direction. It transports power, bidirectional control data, [[Ethernet]], bidirectional audio and multiple streams of unidirectional [[video]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wong |first1=William G |title=GMSL: Automotive Multistreaming with a Single Cable |url=https://www.electronicdesign.com/markets/automotive/article/21805901/gmsl-automotive-multistreaming-with-a-single-cable |website=Electronic Design|date=5 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; simultaneously over a single [[coaxial cable]] or [[shielded twisted pair]] cable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Kemsaram |first1=Narsimlu |last2=Das |first2=Anweshan |last3=Dubbelman |first3=Gijs |chapter=Architecture Design and Development of an On-board Stereo Vision System for Cooperative Automated Vehicles |date=September 2020 |title=2020 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC) |chapter-url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9294435 |pages=1–8 |doi=10.1109/ITSC45102.2020.9294435|isbn=978-1-7281-4149-7 |url=https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10187031/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; A GMSL serializer receives video from a standard digital video interface such as [[HDMI]], [[DisplayPort]], [[Camera Serial Interface]] (CSI-2) or [[Display Serial Interface]] (DSI) and can transmit it over a cable of up to 15 m in length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Complex but necessary technology for automotive: Serial links re-visited |url=https://www.edn.com/complex-but-necessary-technology-for-automotive-serial-links-re-visited/ |website=edn.com |date=2 January 2018 |access-date=23 February 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; The data is received by a GMSL deserializer that can output it on another standard digital video interface. GMSL video transport may be unprotected or encrypted using [[HDCP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hammerschmidt |first1=Christoph |title=HDCP GMSL chipset enables secure transmission of digital content in cars |url=https://www.eetimes.com/hdcp-gmsl-chipset-enables-secure-transmission-of-digital-content-in-cars/ |website=eeTimes |date=24 April 2011 |access-date=23 February 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of GMSL ==
High resolution [[flat-panel display]]s in vehicles started becoming a standard part of [[in-car entertainment]] systems in early 2000 time frame. Backup camera systems were mandated in the US by congress in 2008, and were widely adopted in cars from 2008 to 2011. [https://www.motorbiscuit.com/the-history-of-mandated-backup-cameras/] The first technologies dedicated to connect these displays and cameras were [[FPD-Link]] from National Semiconductor and GMSL from Maxim Integrated. GMSL was introduced in 2008, and supported up to 3.125&amp;nbsp;Gb/s data rate in the [[downlink]] direction. This was sufficient to deliver uncompressed video from the [[head unit]] to high-definition displays commonly used in in-car entertainment systems, and to transport video from cameras to a [[CPU]].&lt;ref name="witt"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Witt |first1=Kevin |date=September 13, 2022 |title=Enabling Enhanced Exterior Vehicle Perception in ADAS and AVs with Gigabit Multimedia Serial Link (GMSL) |journal=AutoSens Conference}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As increasing [[display resolution]]s and camera resolutions  were adopted by the [[automotive industry]], there was a need to transport higher video data rates in automotive video systems. The second generation of GMSL, known as GMSL2 with data rate up to 6&amp;nbsp;Gbit/s became available in 2018. GMSL2 supports [[FHD]] displays and cameras with resolution up to 8 megapixels. [[Display Stream Compression]] was added in GMSL2 to increase the capacity of the link as needed to support 4k displays over a single cable. GMSL2 was also the first generation GMSL to support [[Ethernet]] tunneling. GMSL2 supports 187.5&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s or 1.5&amp;nbsp;Gbit/s data rates on the reverse channel.&lt;ref name="witt" /&gt;

The 3rd generation GMSL devices (GMSL3) became available in 2021. GMSL3 has 12&amp;nbsp;Gbit/s forward data rate, supporting aggregation of multiple cameras, daisy chaining of displays and multiple 4k display video streams over a single cable.&lt;ref name="witt" /&gt;

== Automotive Applications ==

GMSL is primarily used in [[In-Vehicle Infotainment]] (IVI) systems and [[Advanced driver-assistance system]]s (ADAS) in vehicles.

In IVI systems, GMSL links connect displays, such as electronic instrument clusters, navigation systems, center console displays, and rear seat entertainment displays to the vehicle’s head-unit. The full-duplex nature of the link allows transport of video, touch and haptics information, audio and display control, simultaneously over the same cable.

In ADAS systems, GMSL links are used to connect cameras to [[electronic control unit]]s. Examples of such cameras are [[backup camera]]s, [[Omniview technology|surround view]] cameras, [[blind spot monitor]] cameras, forward-looking cameras and [[Driver monitoring system|driver monitoring]] cameras. The GMSL link provides camera power, camera control, fault reporting and video transport across a single, coaxial cable.

ADAS systems are considered [[safety-critical system]]s, and typically have an [[Automotive Safety Integrity Level]] (ASIL) rating, specified according to the [[ISO 26262]] standard. GMSL devices have built-in fault detection and reporting functions to allow design of such ASIL-rated systems.&lt;ref name="matheus" /&gt;

There are other uses for GMSL in the vehicle. Examples include control data distribution for adaptive driving beam headlights,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rise of Adaptive Driving Beam |url=https://www.eetimes.com/rise-of-adaptive-driving-beam/3/ |website=eeTimes |date=5 December 2017 |access-date=23 February 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; transport of [[radar]] and [[lidar]] data in [[autonomous vehicle]]s, and video data transport between domain controllers in a vehicle. For example, surround view camera data can be transported from the ADAS domain controller to the head unit to be displayed to the driver.

[[Automotive electronics]] must operate in an environment with extreme temperatures, high levels of electrical crosstalk and transients. GMSL devices must meet or exceed the requirements of the AEC-Q100 automotive reliability standard for integrated circuits, and the ISO 10605 standard for automotive [[electrostatic discharge]] (ESD).

== Adoption ==
At the AutoSens conference in Brussels in 2022, it was reported that more than 500 million GMSL links are installed in cars from more than 25 car manufacturers.&lt;ref name="witt" /&gt;

'''Data minimization''' is the principle of collecting, processing and storing only the necessary amount of [[personal information]] required for a specific purpose. The principle emanates from the realisation that processing unnecessary data is creating unnecessary risks for the data subject without creating any current benefit or value. The risks of processing personal data vary from [[identity theft]] to unreliable inferences resulting in incorrect, wrongful and potentially dangerous decisions.

The principle of data minimization is a global, universal principle of data protection, and can thus be found in almost every legal or regulatory text on data protection/privacy.

== The data minimization principle in regulatory texts worldwide (selection) ==

* The data minimization principle is the second of the six fundamental privacy principles set forth in the [[General Data Protection Regulation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{CELEX|32016R0679|text=Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[General Data Protection Regulation#United Kingdom implementation|UK GDPR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Principle (c): Data Minimisation|url=https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/data-protection-principles/a-guide-to-the-data-protection-principles/the-principles/data-minimisation/|website=ico.org.uk|date=19 May 2023 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[OECD]] Privacy Guidelines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OECD Privacy Guidelines|url=https://legalinstruments.oecd.org/en/instruments/OECD-LEGAL-0188}}&lt;/ref&gt; refer to the data minimization principle as the ''Collection Limitation Principle'' (part two, article 7).
* The [[American Data Privacy and Protection Act]] (ADPPA), a United States proposed federal online privacy bill that was not enacted included data minimisation as a main principle.&lt;ref name="JDSupra breakdown"&gt;{{Cite web |last1=Dumiak |first1=Matt |title=Federal Privacy Bill: Breaking Down the ADPPA |work=JD Supra |date=2022-06-24 |url=https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/federal-privacy-bill-breaking-down-the-9181745/ |language=en |access-date=2022-07-30 |df=mdy-all |archive-date=June 25, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220625161839/https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/federal-privacy-bill-breaking-down-the-9181745/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''digital download class-action settlements''' were a series of legal settlements by the world's three major record companies, between 2012 and 2015, which ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' called an "important chapter in the legal history of the music business."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gardner |first1=Eriq |title=Universal Music Settling Big Class Action Lawsuit Over Digital Royalties (Exclusive) |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/universal-music-settling-big-class-783096/ |website=hollywoodreporter.com |date=19 March 2015 |publisher=Hollywood Reporter |access-date=31 December 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

The class actions emerged in the aftermath of ''[[F.B.T. Productions, LLC v. Aftermath Records]]'', a lawsuit that created debate within the music industry about whether digital downloads constituted "sales" of records or "licenses" of master recordings within the meaning of most recording contracts, and how that distinction would affect the royalties paid by record companies to artists.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gardner |first1=Eriq |title=Sony Pays $8 Million to Settle Digital Music Class Action Lawsuit |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/sony-digitial-music-class-action-lawsuit-8-million-297761/ |website=www.hollywoodreporter.com |publisher=The Hollywood Reporter |access-date=1 February 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists and record companies differed on how the ''F.B.T.'' ruling would apply, if at all, to other recording contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Manatt, Phelps &amp; Phillips |title=Universal Music Group settles with recording artists over digital downloads |url=https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=a7a857c3-90ec-4439-85e0-d792d7c6b7c2 |website=www.lexology.com |publisher=Lexology |access-date=1 February 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparison of the three settlements is difficult, not only because of the ambiguity of the published reports about Sony's settlement discussed below, but because of the differing market shares of the companies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Market share of record companies in the United States from 2011 to 2019, by label ownership |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/case-summary-labels-dont-owe-fiduciary-duty-to-artists-in-ny-1418283/ |website=www.statista.com |publisher=Statista |access-date=1 February 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; the differences between "claims made" and "common fund" class action settlements,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cabraser |first1=Elizabeth |last2=Pincus |first2=Andrew |title=Claims-Made Class-Action Settlements |url=https://judicature.duke.edu/articles/claims-made-class-action-settlements/ |website=judicature.duke.edu |publisher=Judicature |access-date=1 February 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the unknown number of artists who opted out of the class settlements and the size of their claims. What is clear, however, is that none of the settlements adopted the premise of the ''F.B.T.'' case that download sales should universally be treated contractually as "masters licensed" rather than "records sold."

=== Sony settlement ===

Of the four major record companies in existence in 2012, [[Sony Music]] was the first to settle. Publicly disclosed terms of the settlement included a fund of $7.95 million to pay past claims and a 3 percent increase in artists’ royalty rates with respect to digital income.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Allman Brothers and Cheap Trick possibly have separate digital deals to Sony’s proposed class action settlement |url=https://archive.completemusicupdate.com/article/allman-brothers-and-cheap-trick-possibly-have-separate-digital-deals-to-sonys-proposed-class-action-settlement/ |website=archive.completemusicupdate.com |publisher=CMU |access-date=1 February 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, published reports differed on how this 3% "bump" was to be calculated. Some characterized this as a 3% increase of the base royalty rate itself (e.g., an artist that previously received a 7% royalty on records sold would now receive a 10% royalty on downloads sold, which woulds translate into an effective 42.8% increase in payments).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Houghton |first1=Bruce |title=Sony Settles Allman Brothers Digital Music Lawsuit For $8 Million + 3%, Will Others Follow? |url=https://www.hypebot.com/hypebot/2012/03/sony-settles-allman-brothers-digital-music-lawsuit-for-8-million-3-royalty-bump.html |website=www.hypebot.com |publisher=HypeBot |access-date=1 February 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others characterized the 3% as being a percentage of Sony's gross download receipts -- meaning a royalty rate of 7% would increase to just 7.21% (7% X 1.03), and an artist would receive just 3 percent more of the 70 cents Sony received for 99 cent downloads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Resnikoff |first1=Paul |title=Lawyers Are Getting One-Third of Sony’s $8 Million Legacy Artist Settlement |url=https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2012/03/14/lawyers/ |website=www.digitalmusicnews.com |publisher=Digital Music News |access-date=1 February 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Warner settlement ===

The next to settle was [[Warner Music Group]]. Warner agreed to pay $11.5 million in past royalties and, for future royalties, a 5% increase in the base royalty rate, with a minimum 10% royalty and a maximum 14% royalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Christman |first1=Ed |title=Warner Music Group Submits Class Action Settlement For Digital Royalties Suit |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/warner-music-group-submits-class-action-settlement-for-digital-royalties-5855107/ |website=www.billboard.com |publisher=Billboard |access-date=1 February 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Universal and EMI/Capitol settlement ===

The last to settle was [[Universal Music Group]], a settlement that required review of over 11,000 recording contracts, encompassed claims originally made separately against the fourth major record company, [[EMI|EMI/Capitol Records]], which Universal had acquired during the pendency of the class actions, and potentially applied to over 7,500 artists. Universal agreed to pay $11.5 million, like Warner, and increase digital download royalties by 10%.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gardner |first1=Eriq |title=Universal Music Agrees to Pay $11.5 Million to Settle Digital Royalties Class Action |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/universal-music-agrees-pay-115-788553/ |website=www.hollywoodreporter.com |publisher=The Hollywood Reporter |access-date=1 February 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; This 10% was apparently to be applied to download receipts, meaning the royalty rate on downloads would effectively be raised by 10% of the royalty rate itself-- that is, a 7% royalty rate would become 7.7%, not 17%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gardner |first1=Eriq |title=Universal Music Agrees to Pay $11.5 Million to Settle Digital Royalties Class Action |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/universal-music-agrees-pay-115-788553/ |publisher=The Hollywood Reporter |access-date=1 February 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Panel on the Information Environment''' (IPIE) is an international consortium of over 250 experts&lt;ref&gt;IPIE (2024a).&lt;/ref&gt; from 55 countries dedicated to providing actionable scientific knowledge on threats to the global information environment. The organization has been compared with the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]], but also CERN and the IAEA, because it uses the model of scientific panels and neutral assessments to identify points of consensus or gaps in knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Myers (2023). https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/24/business/researchers-study-misinformation.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240305001814/https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/24/business/researchers-study-misinformation.html|date=2024-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IPIE was legally registered as a charitable entity in the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland in 2023.&lt;ref&gt;Myers (2023).&lt;/ref&gt;
== Panels ==

The first panel was a ''Scientific Panel on Global Standards on AI Auditing,'' chaired by Professor [[Wendy Hui Kyong Chun|Wendy Chun]]; science and technology policy expert Professor [[Alondra Nelson]] served as a member of the panel. At the [[UN Summit of the Future]] in September 2024 the IPIE announced the formation of a ''Scientific Panel on Information Integrity about Climate Science, a Scientific Panel on Child Protection and Social Media'', and a ''Scientific Panel on AI and Peacebuilding''. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=United Nations |date=2024 |title=Summit of the Future |url=https://www.un.org/en/summit-of-the-future |access-date=2024-08-02 |website=United Nations |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IPIE (2024a)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==

The concept was proposed in 2021 during the first Nobel Prize Summit organized by the US [[National Academy of Sciences]] and the [[Nobel Foundation]], involving Dr. Sheldon Himelfarb, then head of PeaceTech Lab,&lt;ref&gt;Lawton (2021). See also Himelfarb et al. (2021).&lt;/ref&gt; and Professor [[Philip N. Howard|Philip N Howard]], a Professor at Oxford University and then Director of the Oxford Internet Institute, &lt;ref&gt;National Academies (2023).&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2022 thirty scientists met at Oxford University to develop a mission statement, organizational structure, and process for developing scientific consensus. This chartering group included researchers from the social, behavioral and computer sciences.  Over time, similar calls to create this independent body have come from public science agencies, civil society, philanthropy, and the technology firms themselves. Some proposals focused exclusively on AI, others on a host of technology-related harms, but there has been strong consensus that the body would need financial independence from technology firms and governments, wouldn't be credibly managed by a steering committee of nation states, and wouldn't function effectively within the UN system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Harris|date=2024|title=Philanthropy's urgent opportunity to create the Interim International AI Institution (IIAII)|publisher=Routledge|url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/oa-edit/10.4324/9781003468615-27/philanthropy-urgent-opportunity-create-interim-international-ai-institution-iiaii-david-evan-harris-anamitra-deb|language=en|doi=10.17181/ESU2020|isbn=9781003468615}}&lt;/ref&gt; A larger group of scientists convened in Costa Rica in February 2023 to continue planning.

In May 2023 the IPIE was publicly launched during the Nobel Prize Summit in Washington DC.&lt;ref name="Snyder"&gt;Snyder (2023).&lt;/ref&gt; The Panel's inaugural announcement said,

{{Blockquote|text = Algorithmic bias, manipulation and misinformation has become a global and existential threat that exacerbates existing social problems, degrades public life, cripples humanitarian initiatives and prevents progress on other serious threats.}}

A New York Times report on the Panel's launch described its initial plans to "issue regular reports, not fact-checking individual falsehoods but rather looking for deeper forces behind the spread of disinformation as a way to guide government policy."&lt;ref&gt;Myers (2023).

== Management ==

The IPIE is currently led by Oxford University Professor [[Philip N. Howard]],&lt;ref&gt;IPIE (2024b).&lt;/ref&gt; who serves a President, and Professor Sebastian Valenzuela from the Catholic University of Chile, who serves as Chief Science Officer.&lt;ref&gt;University of Oxford (2024).&lt;/ref&gt; The IPIE Secretariat includes 10 staff based out of Zurich.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=About IPIE |url=https://www.ipie.info/about |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240328155409/https://www.ipie.info/about |archive-date=2024-03-28 |access-date=2024-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The organization is governed by a small Board of Trustees, a system of permanent methodology, ethics and membership committees, and limited-term scientific panels on particular topics. The Board of Trustees includes [[Inga Beale|Dame Inga Beale]], Susan Doniz, Dr. Sheldon Himelfarb, [[John Momoh]], and Howard Rosen.&lt;ref&gt;IPIE (2024c).&lt;/ref&gt;  

The organization is neutral and nonpartisan, but does seek better access to data from technology companies so as to better appraise the impact of new technologies like AI on public life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Fighting disinformation gets harder, just when it matters most |url=https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2024/05/01/fighting-disinformation-gets-harder-just-when-it-matters-most |access-date=2024-08-27 |newspaper=The Economist |issn=0013-0613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most traditional communication media, including [[telephone]], [[radio]], [[television]], paper mail, and newspapers, are reshaped, redefined, or even bypassed by the Internet, giving birth to new services such as [[email]], [[Internet telephone]], [[Internet radio]], [[Internet television]], [[online music]], digital newspapers, and [[Audio stream|audio]] and [[video streaming]] websites. Newspapers, books, and other print publishing have adapted to [[Web site|website]] technology or have been reshaped into [[blogging]], [[web feed]]s, and online [[news aggregator]]s. The Internet has enabled and accelerated new forms of personal interaction through [[instant messaging]], [[Internet forum]]s, and [[social networking service]]s. [[Online shopping]] has grown exponentially for major retailers, [[small business]]es, and [[entrepreneur]]s, as it enables firms to extend their "[[brick and mortar]]" presence to serve a larger market or even [[Online store|sell goods and services entirely online]]. [[Business-to-business]] and [[financial services]] on the Internet affect [[supply chain]]s across entire industries.

The Internet has no single centralized governance in either technological implementation or policies for access and usage; each constituent network sets its own policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/internet/basics/who-owns-internet.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140619070159/http://computer.howstuffworks.com/internet/basics/who-owns-internet.htm |archive-date=19 June 2014|first=Jonathan|last=Strickland|title=How Stuff Works: Who owns the Internet?|date=3 March 2008|access-date=27 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overarching definitions of the two principal [[name space]]s on the Internet, the [[IP address|Internet Protocol address]] (IP address) space and the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS), are directed by a maintainer organization, the [[Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers]] (ICANN).

The word ''internetted'' was used as early as 1849, meaning ''interconnected'' or ''interwoven''.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|Internetted}} nineteenth-century use as an adjective.&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''Internet'' was used in 1945 by the United States War Department in a radio operator's manual,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=United States Army Field Manual FM 24-6 Radio Operator's Manual Army Ground Forces June 1945 |date=18 September 2023 |url=https://archive.org/details/Fm24-6/mode/2up |publisher=United States War Department }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1974 as the shorthand form of Internetwork.&lt;ref name="RFC675"/&gt; Today, the term ''Internet'' most commonly refers to the global system of interconnected [[computer network]]s, though it may also refer to any group of smaller networks.&lt;ref name="The New York Times"/&gt;

When it came into common use, most publications treated the word ''Internet'' as a capitalized [[Proper noun and common noun|proper noun]]; this has become less common.&lt;ref name="The New York Times" /&gt; This reflects the tendency in English to capitalize new terms and move them to lowercase as they become familiar.&lt;ref name="The New York Times" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wired" /&gt; The word is sometimes still capitalized to distinguish the global internet from smaller networks, though many publications, including the ''[[AP Stylebook]]'' since 2016, recommend the lowercase form in every case.&lt;ref name="The New York Times"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Corbett|first=Philip B.|date=1 June 2016|title=It's Official: The 'Internet' Is Over|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/02/insider/now-it-is-official-the-internet-is-over.html|access-date=29 August 2020|issn=0362-4331|archive-date=14 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201014142148/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/02/insider/now-it-is-official-the-internet-is-over.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Herring|first=Susan C.|date=19 October 2015|title=Should You Be Capitalizing the Word 'Internet'?|magazine=Wired|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/10/should-you-be-capitalizing-the-word-internet/|access-date=29 August 2020|issn=1059-1028|archive-date=31 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201031024342/https://www.wired.com/2015/10/should-you-be-capitalizing-the-word-internet/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' found that, based on a study of around 2.5 billion printed and online sources, "Internet" was capitalized in 54% of cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Coren|first=Michael J.|title=One of the internet's inventors thinks it should still be capitalized|url=https://qz.com/698175/one-of-the-internets-inventors-thinks-it-should-still-be-capitalized/|access-date=8 September 2020|website=Quartz|date=2 June 2016 |language=en|archive-date=27 September 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200927102759/https://qz.com/698175/one-of-the-internets-inventors-thinks-it-should-still-be-capitalized/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-1989, [[MCI Mail]] and [[Compuserve]] established connections to the Internet, delivering email and public access products to the half million users of the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wDAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;q=compuserve%20to%20mci%20mail%20internet&amp;pg=PT31 |title=InfoWorld|date=25 September 1989 |via=Google Books |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170129225422/https://books.google.com/books?id=wDAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT31&amp;lpg=PT31&amp;dq=compuserve%20to%20mci%20mail%20internet |archive-date=29 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Just months later, on 1 January 1990, PSInet launched an alternate Internet backbone for commercial use; one of the networks that added to the core of the commercial Internet of later years. In March 1990, the first high-speed T1 (1.5&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s) link between the NSFNET and Europe was installed between [[Cornell University]] and [[CERN]], allowing much more robust communications than were capable with satellites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=February 1990|title=INTERNET MONTHLY REPORTS|url=http://ftp.cuhk.edu.hk/pub/doc/internet/Internet.Monthly.Report/imr9002.txt|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20170525080041/ftp://ftp.cuhk.edu.hk/pub/doc/internet/Internet.Monthly.Report/imr9002.txt|archive-date=25 May 2017|access-date=28 November 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 1990, [[Tim Berners-Lee]] began writing [[WorldWideWeb]], the first [[web browser]], after two years of lobbying CERN management. By Christmas 1990, Berners-Lee had built all the tools necessary for a working Web: the [[HyperText Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP) 0.9,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/AsImplemented.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19970605071155/http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/AsImplemented.html |archive-date=5 June 1997 |first=Tim |last=Berners-Lee |title=The Original HTTP as defined in 1991 |work=W3C.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[HyperText Markup Language]] (HTML), the first Web browser (which was also an [[HTML editor]] and could access [[Usenet]] newsgroups and [[FTP]] files), the first HTTP [[server application|server software]] (later known as [[CERN httpd]]), the first [[web server]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://info.cern.ch/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105103513/http://info.cern.ch/|title=The website of the world's first-ever web server|archive-date=5 January 2010|website=info.cern.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first Web pages that described the project itself. In 1991 the [[Commercial Internet eXchange]] was founded, allowing PSInet to communicate with the other commercial networks [[CERFnet]] and Alternet. [[Stanford Federal Credit Union]] was the first [[financial institution]] to offer online Internet banking services to all of its members in October 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Stanford Federal Credit Union Pioneers Online Financial Services.|date=21 June 1995|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Stanford+Federal+Credit+Union+Pioneers+Online+Financial+Services.-a017104850|access-date=21 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181221041632/https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Stanford+Federal+Credit+Union+Pioneers+Online+Financial+Services.-a017104850|archive-date=21 December 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, [[OP Financial Group]], also a [[cooperative bank]], became the second online bank in the world and the first in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.op.fi/op-financial-group/about-us/op-financial-group-in-brief/history | title=History – About us – OP Group | access-date=21 December 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181221041413/https://www.op.fi/op-financial-group/about-us/op-financial-group-in-brief/history | archive-date=21 December 2018 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1995, the Internet was fully commercialized in the U.S. when the NSFNet was decommissioned, removing the last restrictions on use of the Internet to carry commercial traffic.&lt;ref name="ConneXions-April1996"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.merit.edu/research/nsfnet_article.php |title=Retiring the NSFNET Backbone Service: Chronicling the End of an Era |first1=Susan R. |last1=Harris |first2=Elise |last2=Gerich |journal=ConneXions |volume=10 |number=4 |date=April 1996 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130817124939/http://merit.edu/research/nsfnet_article.php |archive-date=17 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As technology advanced and commercial opportunities fueled reciprocal growth, the volume of [[Internet traffic]] started experiencing similar characteristics as that of the scaling of [[MOS transistor]]s, exemplified by [[Moore's law]], doubling every 18 months. This growth, formalized as [[Edholm's law]], was catalyzed by advances in [[MOS technology]], [[laser]] light wave systems, and [[Noise (signal processing)|noise]] performance.&lt;ref name="Jindal"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jindal |first1=R.

Since 1995, the Internet has tremendously impacted culture and commerce, including the rise of near-instant communication by email, [[instant messaging]], telephony ([[Voice over Internet Protocol]] or VoIP), [[Video chat|two-way interactive video calls]], and the World Wide Web&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/5242252.stm|title=How the web went world wide|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121092636/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/5242252.stm |archive-date=21 November 2011|first=Mark|last=Ward|website=Technology Correspondent|date=3 August 2006|publisher=BBC News|access-date=24 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with its [[discussion forums]], blogs, [[social networking service]]s, and [[online shopping]] sites. Increasing amounts of data are transmitted at higher and higher speeds over fiber optic networks operating at 1&amp;nbsp;Gbit/s, 10&amp;nbsp;Gbit/s, or more.

The Internet is a [[global network]] that comprises many voluntarily interconnected autonomous networks. It operates without a central governing body. The technical underpinning and standardization of the core protocols ([[IPv4]] and [[IPv6]]) is an activity of the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF), a non-profit organization of loosely affiliated international participants that anyone may associate with by contributing technical expertise. To maintain interoperability, the principal [[name space]]s of the Internet are administered by the [[Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers]] (ICANN). ICANN is governed by an international board of directors drawn from across the Internet technical, business, academic, and other non-commercial communities. ICANN coordinates the assignment of unique identifiers for use on the Internet, including [[domain name]]s, IP addresses, application port numbers in the transport protocols, and many other parameters. Globally unified name spaces are essential for maintaining the global reach of the Internet. This role of ICANN distinguishes it as perhaps the only central coordinating body for the global Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Klein|first=Hans|year=2004|url=http://www.ip3.gatech.edu/research/KLEIN_ICANN%2BSovereignty.doc|title=ICANN and Non-Territorial Sovereignty: Government Without the Nation State|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524035251/http://www.ip3.gatech.edu/research/KLEIN_ICANN%2BSovereignty.doc|archive-date=24 May 2013|website=Internet and Public Policy Project|publisher=[[Georgia Institute of Technology]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Regional Internet registry|Regional Internet registries]] (RIRs) were established for five regions of the world. The [[AfriNIC|African Network Information Center]] (AfriNIC) for [[Africa]], the [[American Registry for Internet Numbers]] (ARIN) for [[North America]], the [[APNIC|Asia–Pacific Network Information Centre]] (APNIC) for [[Asia]] and the [[Pacific region]], the [[Latin American and Caribbean Internet Addresses Registry]] (LACNIC) for [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]] region, and the [[RIPE NCC|Réseaux IP Européens – Network Coordination Centre]] (RIPE NCC) for [[Europe]], the [[Middle East]], and [[Central Asia]] were delegated to assign IP address blocks and other Internet parameters to local registries, such as [[Internet service provider]]s, from a designated pool of addresses set aside for each region.

The communications infrastructure of the Internet consists of its hardware components and a system of software layers that control various aspects of the architecture. As with any computer network, the Internet physically consists of [[router (computing)|router]]s, media (such as cabling and radio links), repeaters, modems etc. However, as an example of [[internetworking]], many of the network nodes are not necessarily Internet equipment per se. The internet packets are carried by other full-fledged networking protocols with the Internet acting as a homogeneous networking standard, running across [[heterogeneous]] hardware, with the packets guided to their destinations by IP routers.

[[Colocation center]]s often host [[private peering]] connections between their customers, internet transit providers, cloud providers,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.servethehome.com/touring-the-phoenixnap-data-center/|title=Touring the PhoenixNAP Data Center|first=Patrick|last=Kennedy|date=22 June 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/analysis/the-rise-and-rebirth-of-carrier-hotels/|title=The rise and rebirth of carrier hotels|first=Dan Swinhoe|last=Comment|date=6 October 2023|website=www.datacenterdynamics.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[meet-me room]]s for connecting customers together&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=Dave Bullock |date=April 3, 2008 |title=A Lesson in Internet Anatomy: The World's Densest Meet-Me Room |url=https://www.wired.com/2008/04/gallery-one-wilshire/ |magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |accessdate=2022-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Internet exchange point]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/awasr-ams-ix-and-alliance-networks-launch-internet-exchange-in-oman/|title=AWASR, AMS-IX, and Alliance Networks launch Internet exchange in Oman|first=Georgia Butler|last=Comment|date=13 September 2023|website=www.datacenterdynamics.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.datacenterfrontier.com/colo/article/55125540/data-center-tours-equinix-dc12-ashburn-virginia|title=Data Center Tours: Equinix DC12, Ashburn, Virginia|first=Matt|last=Vincent|date=16 July 2024|website=Data Center Frontier}}&lt;/ref&gt; and landing points and terminal equipment for fiber optic [[submarine communication cable]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/05/how-the-internet-works-submarine-cables-data-centres-last-mile/|title=How the Internet works: Submarine fiber, brains in jars, and coaxial cables|first=Ars|last=Staff|date=26 May 2016|website=Ars Technica}}&lt;/ref&gt; connecting the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/networking/equinix-expands-miami-data-center-that-s-key-to-latin-american-connectivity|title=Equinix Expands Miami Data Center Key to Latin American Connectivity|website=www.datacenterknowledge.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Service tiers ===
[[File:Internet Connectivity Distribution &amp; Core.svg|thumb|Packet routing across the Internet involves several tiers of Internet service providers.]]

[[Internet service provider]]s (ISPs) establish the worldwide connectivity between individual networks at various levels of scope. End-users who only access the Internet when needed to perform a function or obtain information, represent the bottom of the routing hierarchy. At the top of the routing hierarchy are the [[tier 1 network]]s, large telecommunication companies that exchange traffic directly with each other via very high speed [[fiber-optic cable]]s and governed by [[peering]] agreements. [[Tier 2 network|Tier 2]] and lower-level networks buy [[Internet transit]] from other providers to reach at least some parties on the global Internet, though they may also engage in peering. An ISP may use a single upstream provider for connectivity, or implement [[multihoming]] to achieve redundancy and load balancing. [[Internet exchange point]]s are major traffic exchanges with physical connections to multiple ISPs. Large organizations, such as academic institutions, large enterprises, and governments, may perform the same function as ISPs, engaging in peering and purchasing transit on behalf of their internal networks. Research networks tend to interconnect with large subnetworks such as [[GEANT]], [[GLORIAD]], [[Internet2]], and the UK's [[national research and education network]], [[JANET]].

=== Access ===
Common methods of [[Internet access]] by users include dial-up with a computer [[modem]] via telephone circuits, [[broadband]] over [[coaxial cable]], [[Optical fiber|fiber optics]] or copper wires, [[Wi-Fi]], [[Satellite Internet|satellite]], and [[mobile telephony|cellular telephone]] technology (e.g. [[3G]], [[4G]]). The Internet may often be accessed from computers in libraries and [[Internet café]]s. [[Internet kiosk|Internet access points]] exist in many public places such as airport halls and coffee shops. Various terms are used, such as ''public Internet kiosk'', ''public access terminal'', and ''Web [[payphone]]''. Many hotels also have public terminals that are usually fee-based. These terminals are widely accessed for various usages, such as ticket booking, bank deposit, or [[online payment]]. Wi-Fi provides wireless access to the Internet via local computer networks. [[Wi-Fi hotspot|Hotspots]] providing such access include Wi-Fi cafés, where users need to bring their own wireless devices, such as a laptop or [[Personal Digital Assistant|PDA]]. These services may be free to all, free to customers only, or fee-based.

[[Grassroots]] efforts have led to [[wireless community network]]s. Commercial [[Wi-Fi]] services that cover large areas are available in many cities, such as [[New York City|New York]], [[London]], [[Vienna]], [[Toronto]], [[San Francisco]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Chicago]] and [[Pittsburgh]], where the Internet can then be accessed from places such as a park bench.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pasternak |first=Sean B. |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000082&amp;sid=aQ0ZfhMa4XGQ |title=Toronto Hydro to Install Wireless Network in Downtown Toronto |publisher=Bloomberg |date=7 March 2006 |access-date=8 August 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060410104717/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000082&amp;sid=aQ0ZfhMa4XGQ |archive-date=10 April 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments have also been conducted with proprietary mobile wireless networks like [[Ricochet (Internet service)|Ricochet]], various high-speed data services over cellular networks, and fixed wireless services. Modern [[smartphone]]s can also access the Internet through the cellular carrier network. For Web browsing, these devices provide applications such as [[Google Chrome]], [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]], and [[Firefox]] and a wide variety of other Internet software may be installed from [[app store]]s. Internet usage by mobile and tablet devices exceeded desktop worldwide for the first time in October 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|quote=StatCounter Global Stats finds that mobile and tablet devices accounted for 51.3% of Internet usage worldwide in October compared to 48.7% by desktop.|url=http://gs.statcounter.com/press/mobile-and-tablet-internet-usage-exceeds-desktop-for-first-time-worldwide|title=Mobile and Tablet Internet Usage Exceeds Desktop for First Time Worldwide|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161101170640/http://gs.statcounter.com/press/mobile-and-tablet-internet-usage-exceeds-desktop-for-first-time-worldwide|archive-date=1 November 2016|website=StatCounter: Global Stats, Press Release|date=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Zero-rating]], the practice of Internet service providers allowing users free connectivity to access specific content or applications without cost, has offered opportunities to surmount economic hurdles but has also been accused by its critics as creating a two-tiered Internet. To address the issues with zero-rating, an alternative model has emerged in the concept of 'equal rating' and is being tested in experiments by [[Mozilla]] and [[Orange S.A.|Orange]] in Africa. Equal rating prevents prioritization of one type of content and zero-rates all content up to a specified data cap. In a study published by [[Chatham House]], 15 out of 19 countries researched in Latin America had some kind of hybrid or zero-rated product offered. Some countries in the region had a handful of plans to choose from (across all mobile network operators) while others, such as [[Colombia]], offered as many as 30 pre-paid and 34 post-paid plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Galpaya|first=Helani|date=12 April 2019|title=Zero-rating in Emerging Economies|url=https://www.cigionline.org/sites/default/files/documents/GCIG%20no.47_1.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190412062932/https://www.cigionline.org/sites/default/files/documents/GCIG%20no.47_1.pdf|archive-date=12 April 2019|access-date=28 November 2020|website=Global Commission on Internet Governance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Internet Protocol Suite ==
{{IP stack}}
The Internet standards describe a framework known as the [[Internet protocol suite]] (also called [[TCP/IP]], based on the first two components.) This is a suite of protocols that are ordered into a set of four conceptional [[Communication protocol#Layering|layers]] by the scope of their operation, originally documented in {{IETF RFC|1122}} and {{IETF RFC|1123}}. At the top is the [[application layer]], where communication is described in terms of the objects or data structures most appropriate for each application. For example, a web browser operates in a [[client–server model|client–server]] application model and exchanges information with the [[HyperText Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP) and an application-germane data structure, such as the [[HTML|HyperText Markup Language]] (HTML).

Below this top layer, the [[transport layer]] connects applications on different hosts with a logical channel through the network. It provides this service with a variety of possible characteristics, such as ordered, reliable delivery (TCP), and an unreliable datagram service (UDP).

Underlying these layers are the networking technologies that interconnect networks at their borders and exchange traffic across them. The [[Internet layer]] implements the [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) which enables computers to identify and locate each other by [[IP address]] and route their traffic via intermediate (transit) networks.&lt;ref name=rfc791&gt;{{Cite IETF|rfc=791|title=Internet Protocol, DARPA Internet Program Protocol Specification|editor=[[Jon Postel|J. Postel]]|date=September 1981|publisher=[[IETF]]}} Updated by {{IETF RFC|1349|2474|6864}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Internet Protocol layer code is independent of the type of network that it is physically running over.

At the bottom of the architecture is the [[link layer]], which connects nodes on the same physical link, and contains protocols that do not require routers for traversal to other links. The protocol suite does not explicitly specify hardware methods to transfer bits, or protocols to manage such hardware, but assumes that appropriate technology is available. Examples of that technology include [[Wi-Fi]], [[Ethernet]], and [[DSL]].

[[File:UDP encapsulation.svg|thumb|As user data is processed through the protocol stack, each abstraction layer adds encapsulation information at the sending host. Data is transmitted ''over the wire'' at the link level between hosts and routers. Encapsulation is removed by the receiving host. Intermediate relays update link encapsulation at each hop, and inspect the IP layer for routing purposes.]]

===Internet protocol===
[[Image:IP stack connections.svg|thumb|Conceptual data flow in a simple network topology of two hosts (''A'' and ''B'') connected by a link between their respective routers. The application on each host executes read and write operations as if the processes were directly connected to each other by some kind of data pipe. After the establishment of this pipe, most details of the communication are hidden from each process, as the underlying principles of communication are implemented in the lower protocol layers. In analogy, at the transport layer the communication appears as host-to-host, without knowledge of the application data structures and the connecting routers, while at the internetworking layer, individual network boundaries are traversed at each router.]]
The most prominent component of the Internet model is the Internet Protocol (IP). IP enables internetworking and, in essence, establishes the Internet itself. Two versions of the Internet Protocol exist, [[IPv4]] and [[IPv6]].

====IP Addresses====
[[File:An example of theoretical DNS recursion.svg|right|thumb|A DNS resolver consults three name servers to resolve the domain name user-visible "www.wikipedia.org" to determine the IPv4 Address 207.142.131.234.]]
For locating individual computers on the network, the Internet provides [[IP address]]es. IP addresses are used by the Internet infrastructure to direct internet packets to their destinations. They consist of fixed-length numbers, which are found within the packet. IP addresses are generally assigned to equipment either automatically via [[DHCP]], or are configured.

However, the network also supports other addressing systems. Users generally enter [[fully qualified domain name|domain name]]s (e.g. "en.wikipedia.org") instead of IP addresses because they are easier to remember; they are converted by the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) into IP addresses which are more efficient for routing purposes.

====IPv4====
[[IPv4|Internet Protocol version 4]] (IPv4) defines an IP address as a [[32-bit]] number.&lt;ref name="rfc791"/&gt; IPv4 is the initial version used on the first generation of the Internet and is still in dominant use. It was designed in 1981 to address up to ≈4.3&amp;nbsp;billion (10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;) hosts. However, the explosive growth of the Internet has led to [[IPv4 address exhaustion]], which entered its final stage in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Huston |first=Geoff |title=IPv4 Address Report, daily generated |url=http://www.potaroo.net/tools/ipv4/index.html |access-date=20 May 2009 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401001902/http://www.potaroo.net/tools/ipv4/index.html |archive-date=1 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; when the global IPv4 address allocation pool was exhausted.

====IPv6====
Because of the growth of the Internet and the [[IPv4 address exhaustion|depletion of available IPv4 addresses]], a new version of IP [[IPv6]], was developed in the mid-1990s, which provides vastly larger addressing capabilities and more efficient routing of Internet traffic. IPv6 uses 128 bits for the IP address and was standardized in 1998.&lt;ref name=rfc1883&gt;{{Cite IETF|rfc=1883|title=Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification|author-link1=Steve Deering|author1=S. Deering|author2=R. Hinden|date=December 1995|publisher=Network Working Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rfc2460&gt;{{Cite IETF|rfc=2460|title=Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification|author-link1=Steve Deering|author1=S. Deering|author2=R. Hinden|publisher=Network Working Group|date=December 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rfc8200&gt;{{Cite IETF|rfc=8200|title=Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification|author-link1=Steve Deering|author1=S. Deering|author2=R. Hinden|publisher=[[IETF]]|date=July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IPv6 deployment]] has been ongoing since the mid-2000s and is currently in growing deployment around the world, since Internet address registries ([[Regional Internet registry|RIRs]]) began to urge all resource managers to plan rapid adoption and conversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.arin.net/knowledge/about_resources/ceo_letter.pdf |title=Notice of Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) Address Depletion |access-date=7 August 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107095025/https://www.arin.net/knowledge/about_resources/ceo_letter.pdf |archive-date=7 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

IPv6 is not directly interoperable by design with IPv4. In essence, it establishes a parallel version of the Internet not directly accessible with IPv4 software. Thus, translation facilities must exist for internetworking or nodes must have duplicate networking software for both networks. Essentially all modern computer operating systems support both versions of the Internet Protocol. Network infrastructure, however, has been lagging in this development. Aside from the complex array of physical connections that make up its infrastructure, the Internet is facilitated by bi- or multi-lateral commercial contracts, e.g., [[peering agreement]]s, and by technical specifications or protocols that describe the exchange of data over the network. Indeed, the Internet is defined by its interconnections and routing policies.

====Subnetwork====
[[File:Subnetting Concept-en.svg|thumb|300px|right|Creating a subnet by dividing the host identifier]]
A ''[[subnetwork]]'' or ''subnet'' is a logical subdivision of an [[IP network]].&lt;ref name="rfc950"&gt;{{Cite IETF|rfc=950|publisher=[[IETF]]|author1=Jeffrey Mogul|author2=Jon Postel|author-link2=Jon Postel|title=Internet Standard Subnetting Procedure|date=August 1985}} Updated by RFC 6918.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1,16}} The practice of dividing a network into two or more networks is called ''subnetting''. Computers that belong to a subnet are addressed with an identical [[most-significant bit]]-group in their IP addresses. This results in the logical division of an IP address into two fields, the ''network number'' or ''routing prefix'' and the ''rest field'' or ''host identifier''. The ''rest field'' is an identifier for a specific [[Host (network)|host]] or network interface.

The ''routing prefix'' may be expressed in [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing]] (CIDR) notation written as the first address of a network, followed by a slash character (''/''), and ending with the bit-length of the prefix. For example, {{IPaddr|198.51.100.0|24}} is the prefix of the [[Internet Protocol version 4]] network starting at the given address, having 24 bits allocated for the network prefix, and the remaining 8 bits reserved for host addressing. Addresses in the range {{IPaddr|198.51.100.0}} to {{IPaddr|198.51.100.255}} belong to this network. The IPv6 address specification {{IPaddr|2001:db8::|32}} is a large address block with 2&lt;sup&gt;96&lt;/sup&gt; addresses, having a 32-bit routing prefix.

For IPv4, a network may also be characterized by its ''subnet mask'' or ''netmask'', which is the [[bitmask]] that when applied by a [[bitwise AND]] operation to any IP address in the network, yields the routing prefix. Subnet masks are also expressed in [[dot-decimal notation]] like an address. For example, {{IPaddr|255.255.255.0}} is the subnet mask for the prefix {{IPaddr|198.51.100.0|24}}.

Traffic is exchanged between subnetworks through routers when the routing prefixes of the source address and the destination address differ. A router serves as a logical or physical boundary between the subnets.

The benefits of subnetting an existing network vary with each deployment scenario. In the address allocation architecture of the Internet using CIDR and in large organizations, it is necessary to allocate address space efficiently. Subnetting may also enhance routing efficiency or have advantages in network management when subnetworks are administratively controlled by different entities in a larger organization. Subnets may be arranged logically in a hierarchical architecture, partitioning an organization's network address space into a tree-like routing structure.

====Routing====
Computers and routers use [[routing table]]s in their operating system to [[IP forwarding|direct IP packets]] to reach a node on a different subnetwork. Routing tables are maintained by manual configuration or automatically by [[routing protocol]]s. End-nodes typically use a [[default route]] that points toward an ISP providing transit, while ISP routers use the [[Border Gateway Protocol]] to establish the most efficient routing across the complex connections of the global Internet. The [[default gateway]] is the [[Node (networking)|node]] that serves as the forwarding host (router) to other networks when no other route specification matches the destination [[IP address]] of a packet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-find-your-default-gateway-ip-address-2626072|title=How to Find Your Default Gateway IP Address|last=Fisher|first=Tim|website=[[Lifewire]]|access-date=25 February 2019|archive-date=25 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190225162425/https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-find-your-default-gateway-ip-address-2626072|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.techopedia.com/definition/2184/default-gateway|title=Default Gateway|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201026160616/https://www.techopedia.com/definition/2184/default-gateway|archive-date=26 October 2020|website=techopedia.com|date=30 June 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===IETF===
While the hardware components in the Internet infrastructure can often be used to support other software systems, it is the design and the standardization process of the software that characterizes the Internet and provides the foundation for its scalability and success. The responsibility for the architectural design of the Internet software systems has been assumed by the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ietf.org/ |title=IETF Home Page |publisher=Ietf.org |access-date=20 June 2009 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618032558/http://www.ietf.org/ |archive-date=18 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The IETF conducts standard-setting work groups, open to any individual, about the various aspects of Internet architecture. The resulting contributions and standards are published as ''[[Request for Comments]]'' (RFC) documents on the IETF web site. The principal methods of networking that enable the Internet are contained in specially designated RFCs that constitute the [[Internet Standard]]s. Other less rigorous documents are simply informative, experimental, or historical, or document the best current practices (BCP) when implementing Internet technologies.

== Applications and services ==
The Internet carries many [[network service|applications and services]], most prominently the World Wide Web, including [[social media]], [[electronic mail]], [[mobile app]]lications, [[multiplayer online game]]s, [[Internet telephony]], [[file sharing]], and [[streaming media]] services. Most [[Server (computing)|servers]] that provide these services are today hosted in [[data center]]s, and content is often accessed through high-performance [[content delivery network]]s.

=== World Wide Web ===
{{Main|World Wide Web}}
[[File:First Web Server.jpg|thumb|This [[NeXT Computer]] was used by [[Tim Berners-Lee]] at [[CERN]] and became the world's first [[Web server]].]]

The World Wide Web is a global collection of [[documents]], [[Computer graphics|images]], [[multimedia]], applications, and other resources, logically interrelated by [[hyperlink]]s and referenced with [[Uniform Resource Identifier]]s (URIs), which provide a global system of named references. URIs symbolically identify services, [[web servers]], databases, and the documents and resources that they can provide. [[HyperText Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP) is the main access protocol of the World Wide Web. [[Web service]]s also use HTTP for communication between software systems for information transfer, sharing and exchanging business data and logistics and is one of many languages or protocols that can be used for communication on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webopedia.com/DidYouKnow/Internet/Web_vs_Internet.asp |title=The Difference Between the Internet and the World Wide Web |work=Webopedia |publisher=QuinStreet Inc. |date=24 June 2010 |access-date=1 May 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502001005/http://www.webopedia.com/DidYouKnow/Internet/Web_vs_Internet.asp |archive-date=2 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

World Wide Web browser software, such as [[Microsoft]]'s [[Internet Explorer]]/[[Microsoft Edge (series of web browsers)|Edge]], [[Mozilla Firefox]], [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]], and [[Google Chrome]], enable users to navigate from one web page to another via the hyperlinks embedded in the documents. These documents may also contain any combination of [[computer data]], including graphics, sounds, [[Plain text|text]], [[web video|video]], [[multimedia]] and interactive content that runs while the user is interacting with the page. [[Client-side scripting|Client-side software]] can include animations, [[web game|games]], [[office applications]] and scientific demonstrations. Through [[keyword (Internet search)|keyword]]-driven [[Internet research]] using [[Web search engine|search engines]] like [[Yahoo! Search|Yahoo!]], [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]] and [[Google Search|Google]], users worldwide have easy, instant access to a vast and diverse amount of online information. Compared to printed media, books, encyclopedias and traditional libraries, the World Wide Web has enabled the decentralization of information on a large scale.

The Web has enabled individuals and organizations to [[publish]] ideas and information to a potentially large [[audience]] online at greatly reduced expense and time delay. Publishing a web page, a blog, or building a website involves little initial [[cost]] and many cost-free services are available. However, publishing and maintaining large, professional websites with attractive, diverse and up-to-date information is still a difficult and expensive proposition. Many individuals and some companies and groups use ''web logs'' or blogs, which are largely used as easily being able to update online diaries. Some commercial organizations encourage [[employees|staff]] to communicate advice in their areas of specialization in the hope that visitors will be impressed by the expert knowledge and free information and be attracted to the corporation as a result.

[[Online advertising|Advertising]] on popular web pages can be lucrative, and [[e-commerce]], which is the sale of products and services directly via the Web, continues to grow. Online advertising is a form of [[marketing]] and advertising which uses the Internet to deliver [[promotion (marketing)|promotional]] marketing messages to consumers. It includes email marketing, [[search engine marketing]] (SEM), social media marketing, many types of [[display advertising]] (including [[web banner]] advertising), and [[mobile advertising]]. In 2011, Internet advertising revenues in the United States surpassed those of [[cable television]] and nearly exceeded those of [[broadcast television]].&lt;ref name="IAB2012"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.iab.net/media/file/IAB_Internet_Advertising_Revenue_Report_FY_2012_rev.pdf |title = IAB Internet advertising revenue report: 2012 full year results |date = April 2013 |publisher = PricewaterhouseCoopers, Internet Advertising Bureau |access-date = 12 June 2013 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141004001439/http://www.iab.net/media/file/IAB_Internet_Advertising_Revenue_Report_FY_2012_rev.pdf |archive-date = 4 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|19}} Many common online advertising practices are controversial and increasingly subject to regulation.

When the Web developed in the 1990s, a typical web page was stored in completed form on a web server, formatted in [[HTML]], ready for transmission to a web browser in response to a request. Over time, the process of creating and serving web pages has become dynamic, creating a flexible design, layout, and content. Websites are often created using [[content management]] software with, initially, very little content. Contributors to these systems, who may be paid staff, members of an organization or the public, fill underlying databases with content using editing pages designed for that purpose while casual visitors view and read this content in HTML form. There may or may not be editorial, approval and security systems built into the process of taking newly entered content and making it available to the target visitors.

=== Communication ===
[[Email]] is an important communications service available via the Internet. The concept of sending electronic text messages between parties, analogous to mailing letters or memos, predates the creation of the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Ron|last=Brown|title=Fax invades the mail market|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ry64sjvOmLkC&amp;pg=PA218|journal=New Scientist|volume=56|issue=817|date=October 26, 1972|pages=218–221}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Herbert P.|last=Luckett|title=What's News: Electronic-mail delivery gets started|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cKSqa8u3EIoC&amp;pg=PA85|journal=Popular Science|volume=202|issue=3|date=March 1973|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pictures, documents, and other files are sent as [[email attachment]]s. Email messages can be [[Carbon copy|cc-ed]] to multiple [[email address]]es.

[[Internet telephony]] is a common communications service realized with the Internet. The name of the principal internetworking protocol, the Internet Protocol, lends its name to [[voice over Internet Protocol]] (VoIP). The idea began in the early 1990s with [[walkie-talkie]]-like voice applications for personal computers. VoIP systems now dominate many markets and are as easy to use and as convenient as a traditional telephone. The benefit has been substantial cost savings over traditional telephone calls, especially over long distances. [[Cable modem|Cable]], [[ADSL]], and [[mobile data]] networks provide [[Internet access]] in customer premises&lt;ref name=EBSCOhost&gt;{{cite journal|last=Booth|first=C|title=Chapter 2: IP Phones, Software VoIP, and Integrated and Mobile VoIP|journal=Library Technology Reports|year=2010|volume=46|issue=5|pages=11–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and inexpensive VoIP network adapters provide the connection for traditional analog telephone sets. The voice quality of VoIP often exceeds that of traditional calls. Remaining problems for VoIP include the situation that emergency services may not be universally available and that devices rely on a local power supply, while older traditional phones are powered from the local loop, and typically operate during a power failure.

=== Data transfer ===
[[File sharing]] is an example of transferring large amounts of data across the Internet. A [[computer file]] can be emailed to customers, colleagues and friends as an attachment. It can be uploaded to a website or [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP) server for easy download by others. It can be put into a "shared location" or onto a [[file server]] for instant use by colleagues. The load of bulk downloads to many users can be eased by the use of "[[Web mirror|mirror]]" servers or [[peer-to-peer]] networks. In any of these cases, access to the file may be controlled by user [[authentication]], the transit of the file over the Internet may be obscured by [[encryption]], and money may change hands for access to the file. The price can be paid by the remote charging of funds from, for example, a credit card whose details are also passed—usually fully encrypted—across the Internet. The origin and authenticity of the file received may be checked by [[digital signature]]s or by [[MD5]] or other message digests. These simple features of the Internet, over a worldwide basis, are changing the production, sale, and distribution of anything that can be reduced to a computer file for transmission. This includes all manner of print publications, software products, news, music, film, video, photography, graphics and the other arts. This in turn has caused seismic shifts in each of the existing industries that previously controlled the production and distribution of these products.

[[Streaming media]] is the real-time delivery of digital media for immediate consumption or enjoyment by end users. Many radio and television broadcasters provide Internet feeds of their live audio and video productions. They may also allow time-shift viewing or listening such as Preview, Classic Clips and Listen Again features. These providers have been joined by a range of pure Internet "broadcasters" who never had on-air licenses. This means that an Internet-connected device, such as a computer or something more specific, can be used to access online media in much the same way as was previously possible only with a television or radio receiver. The range of available types of content is much wider, from specialized technical [[webcast]]s to on-demand popular multimedia services. [[Podcast]]ing is a variation on this theme, where—usually audio—material is downloaded and played back on a computer or shifted to a [[portable media player]] to be listened to on the move. These techniques using simple equipment allow anybody, with little censorship or licensing control, to broadcast audio-visual material worldwide. Digital media streaming increases the demand for network bandwidth. For example, standard image quality needs 1&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s link speed for SD 480p, HD 720p quality requires 2.5&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s, and the top-of-the-line HDX quality needs 4.5&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s for 1080p.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Morrison |first=Geoff |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/40241749 |title=What to know before buying a 'connected' TV – Technology &amp; science – Tech and gadgets – Tech Holiday Guide |publisher=NBC News |date=18 November 2010 |access-date=8 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200212091603/http://www.nbcnews.com/id/40241749 |archive-date=12 February 2020 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Webcam]]s are a low-cost extension of this phenomenon. While some webcams can give full-frame-rate video, the picture either is usually small or updates slowly. Internet users can watch animals around an African waterhole, ships in the [[Panama Canal]], traffic at a local roundabout or monitor their own premises, live and in real time. Video [[chat rooms]] and [[video conferencing]] are also popular with many uses being found for personal webcams, with and without two-way sound. YouTube was founded on 15 February 2005 and is now the leading website for free streaming video with more than two billion users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Press|url=https://www.youtube.com/about/press/|access-date=19 August 2020|website=YouTube|archive-date=11 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171111094352/https://www.youtube.com/yt/about/press/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses an HTML5 based web player by default to stream and show video files.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://youtube-eng.googleblog.com/2015/01/youtube-now-defaults-to-html5_27.html|title=YouTube now defaults to HTML5|work=YouTube Engineering and Developers Blog|access-date=10 September 2018|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180910204225/https://youtube-eng.googleblog.com/2015/01/youtube-now-defaults-to-html5_27.html|archive-date=10 September 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Registered users may upload an unlimited amount of video and build their own personal profile. [[YouTube]] claims that its users watch hundreds of millions, and upload hundreds of thousands of videos daily.

== Social impact ==
The Internet has enabled new forms of social interaction, activities, and social associations. This phenomenon has given rise to the scholarly study of the [[sociology of the Internet]]. The early Internet left an impact on some [[writer]]s who used [[symbol]]ism to write about it, such as describing the Internet as a "means to connect individuals in a vast invisible net over all the [[earth]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Carlson |first1=Kathie |title=The Book of Symbols: Reflections on Archetypal Images |last2=Flanagin |first2=Michael N. |last3=Martin |first3=Kathleen |last4=Martin |first4=Mary E. |last5=Mendelsohn |first5=John |last6=Rodgers |first6=Priscilla Young |last7=Ronnberg |first7=Ami |last8=Salman |first8=Sherry |last9=Wesley |first9=Deborah A. |publisher=[[Taschen]] |year=2010 |isbn=978-3-8365-1448-4 |editor-last=Arm |editor-first=Karen |location=Köln |page=518 |editor-last2=Ueda |editor-first2=Kako |editor-last3=Thulin |editor-first3=Anne |editor-last4=Langerak |editor-first4=Allison |editor-last5=Kiley |editor-first5=Timothy Gus |editor-last6=Wolff |editor-first6=Mary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2000 and 2009, the number of Internet users globally rose from 390&amp;nbsp;million to 1.9&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Pages/stat/ Internet users graphs] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200509175322/https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Pages/stat/default.aspx |date=9 May 2020 }}, Market Information and Statistics, International Telecommunication Union&lt;/ref&gt; By 2010, 22% of the world's population had access to computers with 1&amp;nbsp;billion [[Google]] searches every day, 300&amp;nbsp;million Internet users reading blogs, and 2&amp;nbsp;billion videos viewed daily on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antaranews.com/en/news/71940/google-earth-demonstrates-how-technology-benefits-ris-civil-society-govt |title=Google Earth demonstrates how technology benefits RI's civil society, govt |publisher=Antara News |date=26 May 2011 |access-date=19 November 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121029074528/http://www.antaranews.com/en/news/71940/google-earth-demonstrates-how-technology-benefits-ris-civil-society-govt |archive-date=29 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 the world's Internet users surpassed 3&amp;nbsp;billion or 44 percent of world population, but two-thirds came from the richest countries, with 78 percent of Europeans using the Internet, followed by 57 percent of the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/11/25/3-billion-internet-users/ |title=There are now 3 billion Internet users, mostly in rich countries |author=Steve Dent |date=25 November 2014 |access-date=25 November 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141128020032/http://www.engadget.com/2014/11/25/3-billion-internet-users/ |archive-date=28 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 2018, Asia alone accounted for 51% of all Internet users, with 2.2&amp;nbsp;billion out of the 4.3&amp;nbsp;billion Internet users in the world.

The prevalent language for communication via the Internet has always been English. This may be a result of the origin of the Internet, as well as the language's role as a [[lingua franca]] and as a [[world language]]. Early computer systems were limited to the characters in the [[ASCII|American Standard Code for Information Interchange]] (ASCII), a subset of the [[Latin alphabet]]. After English (27%), the most requested languages on the World Wide Web are Chinese (25%), Spanish (8%), Japanese (5%), Portuguese and German (4% each), Arabic, French and Russian (3% each), and Korean (2%).&lt;ref name="NIUBL-IWS" /&gt;&lt;!-- Note that the use of these copyright statistics is dependent on "giving due credit and establishing an active link back to www.internetworldstats.com", so please do not remove the citation above --&gt; The Internet's technologies have developed enough in recent years, especially in the use of [[Unicode]], that good facilities are available for development and communication in the world's widely used languages. However, some glitches such as ''[[mojibake]]'' (incorrect display of some languages' characters) still remain.

In a US study in 2005, the percentage of men using the Internet was very slightly ahead of the percentage of women, although this difference reversed in those under 30. Men logged on more often, spent more time online, and were more likely to be broadband users, whereas women tended to make more use of opportunities to communicate (such as email). Men were more likely to use the Internet to pay bills, participate in auctions, and for recreation such as downloading music and videos. Men and women were equally likely to use the Internet for shopping and banking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Fallows |first=Deborah |date=2005-12-28 |title=How Women and Men Use the Internet |url=https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2005/12/28/how-women-and-men-use-the-internet/ |website=Pew Research Center |language=en-US |url-status=live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20230608191432/https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2005/12/28/how-women-and-men-use-the-internet/ |archive-date= Jun 8, 2023 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, women significantly outnumbered men on most social networking services, such as Facebook and Myspace, although the ratios varied with age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://business.rapleaf.com/company_press_2008_07_29.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320211742/http://business.rapleaf.com/company_press_2008_07_29.html|archive-date=20 March 2009 |title=Rapleaf Study Reveals Gender and Age Data of Social Network Users |website=Rapleaf  |date=July 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women watched more streaming content, whereas men downloaded more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/tradejournals/article/178175272.html |title=Women Ahead of Men in Online Tv, Dvr, Games, And Social Media. |publisher=Entrepreneur |date=1 May 2008 |access-date=8 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916094836/http://www.entrepreneur.com/tradejournals/article/178175272.html |archive-date=16 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Men were more likely to blog.

The Internet allows greater flexibility in working hours and location, especially with the spread of unmetered high-speed connections. The Internet can be accessed almost anywhere by numerous means, including through [[mobile Internet device]]s. Mobile phones, [[datacard]]s, [[handheld game console]]s and [[cellular router]]s allow users to connect to the Internet [[wireless]]ly. Within the limitations imposed by small screens and other limited facilities of such pocket-sized devices, the services of the Internet, including email and the web, may be available. Service providers may restrict the services offered and mobile data charges may be significantly higher than other access methods.

Educational material at all levels from pre-school to post-doctoral is available from websites. Examples range from [[CBeebies]], through school and high-school revision guides and [[Virtual university|virtual universities]], to access to top-end scholarly literature through the likes of [[Google Scholar]]. For [[distance education]], help with [[homework]] and other assignments, self-guided learning, whiling away spare time or just looking up more detail on an interesting fact, it has never been easier for people to access educational information at any level from anywhere. The Internet in general and the World Wide Web in particular are important enablers of both [[Education|formal]] and [[informal education]]. Further, the Internet allows researchers (especially those from the social and behavioral sciences) to conduct research remotely via virtual laboratories, with profound changes in reach and generalizability of findings as well as in communication between scientists and in the publication of results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reips|first=U.-D.|year=2008|chapter=How Internet-mediated research changes science|url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/psychology/social-psychology/psychological-aspects-cyberspace-theory-research-applications|title=Psychological aspects of cyberspace: Theory, research, applications|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809235408/http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/psychology/social-psychology/psychological-aspects-cyberspace-theory-research-applications|archive-date=9 August 2014|pages=268–294|location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-69464-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The low cost and nearly instantaneous sharing of ideas, knowledge, and skills have made [[collaboration|collaborative]] work dramatically easier, with the help of [[collaborative software]]. Not only can a group cheaply communicate and share ideas but the wide reach of the Internet allows such groups more easily to form. An example of this is the [[free software movement]], which has produced, among other things, [[Linux]], [[Mozilla Firefox]], and [[OpenOffice.org]] (later forked into [[LibreOffice]]). Internet chat, whether using an [[IRC]] chat room, an [[instant messaging]] system, or a social networking service, allows colleagues to stay in touch in a very convenient way while working at their computers during the day. Messages can be exchanged even more quickly and conveniently than via email. These systems may allow files to be exchanged, drawings and images to be shared, or voice and video contact between team members.

[[Content management]] systems allow collaborating teams to work on shared sets of documents simultaneously without accidentally destroying each other's work. Business and project teams can share calendars as well as documents and other information. Such collaboration occurs in a wide variety of areas including scientific research, software development, conference planning, political activism and creative writing. Social and political collaboration is also becoming more widespread as both Internet access and [[computer literacy]] spread.

The Internet allows computer users to remotely access other computers and information stores easily from any access point. Access may be with [[computer security]]; i.e., authentication and encryption technologies, depending on the requirements. This is encouraging new ways of [[remote work]], collaboration and information sharing in many industries. An accountant sitting at home can [[audit]] the books of a company based in another country, on a server situated in a third country that is remotely maintained by IT specialists in a fourth. These accounts could have been created by home-working bookkeepers, in other remote locations, based on information emailed to them from offices all over the world. Some of these things were possible before the widespread use of the Internet, but the cost of private [[leased line]]s would have made many of them infeasible in practice. An office worker away from their desk, perhaps on the other side of the world on a business trip or a holiday, can access their emails, access their data using [[cloud computing]], or open a [[Remote Desktop Protocol|remote desktop]] session into their office PC using a secure [[virtual private network]] (VPN) connection on the Internet. This can give the worker complete access to all of their normal files and data, including email and other applications, while away from the office. It has been referred to among [[system administrator]]s as the Virtual Private Nightmare,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Virtual Private Nightmare: VPN |url=http://librenix.com/?inode=5013 |publisher=Librenix |access-date=21 July 2010 |date=4 August 2004 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515152637/http://librenix.com/?inode=5013 |archive-date=15 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; because it extends the secure perimeter of a corporate network into remote locations and its employees' homes. By the late 2010s the Internet had been described as "the main source of scientific information "for the majority of the global North population".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dariusz Jemielniak|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yLDMDwAAQBAJ|title=Collaborative Society|author2=Aleksandra Przegalinska|year= 2020|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-35645-9|access-date=26 November 2020|archive-date=23 November 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201123045652/https://books.google.com/books?id=yLDMDwAAQBAJ|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|111}}

=== Social networking and entertainment ===
{{See also|Social networking service#Social impact}}
Many people use the World Wide Web to access news, weather and sports reports, to plan and book vacations and to pursue their personal interests. People use [[online chat|chat]], messaging and email to make and stay in touch with friends worldwide, sometimes in the same way as some previously had [[pen pal]]s. Social networking services such as [[Facebook]] have created new ways to socialize and interact. Users of these sites are able to add a wide variety of information to pages, pursue common interests, and connect with others. It is also possible to find existing acquaintances, to allow communication among existing groups of people. Sites like [[LinkedIn]] foster commercial and business connections. YouTube and [[Flickr]] specialize in users' videos and photographs. Social networking services are also widely used by businesses and other organizations to promote their brands, to market to their customers and to encourage posts to "[[Viral marketing|go viral]]". "Black hat" social media techniques are also employed by some organizations, such as [[Spamming|spam]] accounts and [[astroturfing]].

A risk for both individuals' and organizations' writing posts (especially public posts) on social networking services is that especially foolish or controversial posts occasionally lead to an unexpected and possibly large-scale backlash on social media from other Internet users. This is also a risk in relation to controversial ''offline'' behavior, if it is widely made known. The nature of this backlash can range widely from counter-arguments and public mockery, through insults and [[hate speech]], to, in extreme cases, rape and death [[Computer crime#Online harassment|threats]]. The [[online disinhibition effect]] describes the tendency of many individuals to behave more stridently or offensively online than they would in person. A significant number of [[feminist]] women have been the target of various forms of [[harassment]] in response to posts they have made on social media, and Twitter in particular has been criticized in the past for not doing enough to aid victims of online abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-23477130 |title=Twitter 'report abuse' button calls after rape threats |last=Moore |first=Keith |date=27 July 2013 |work=[[BBC News]] |access-date=7 December 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904014545/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-23477130 |archive-date=4 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For organizations, such a backlash can cause overall [[public relations|brand damage]], especially if reported by the media. However, this is not always the case, as any brand damage in the eyes of people with an opposing opinion to that presented by the organization could sometimes be outweighed by strengthening the brand in the eyes of others. Furthermore, if an organization or individual gives in to demands that others perceive as wrong-headed, that can then provoke a counter-backlash.

Some websites, such as [[Reddit]], have rules forbidding the posting of [[personal information]] of individuals (also known as [[doxxing]]), due to concerns about such postings leading to mobs of large numbers of Internet users directing harassment at the specific individuals thereby identified. In particular, the Reddit rule forbidding the posting of personal information is widely understood to imply that all identifying photos and names must be [[censored]] in Facebook [[screenshots]] posted to Reddit. However, the interpretation of this rule in relation to public Twitter posts is less clear, and in any case, like-minded people online have many other ways they can use to direct each other's attention to public social media posts they disagree with.

Children also face dangers online such as [[cyberbullying]] and [[Child grooming|approaches by sexual predators]], who sometimes pose as children themselves. Children may also encounter material that they may find upsetting, or material that their parents consider to be not age-appropriate. Due to naivety, they may also post personal information about themselves online, which could put them or their families at risk unless warned not to do so. Many parents choose to enable [[Content-control software|Internet filtering]] or supervise their children's online activities in an attempt to protect their children from inappropriate material on the Internet. The most popular social networking services, such as Facebook and Twitter, commonly forbid users under the age of 13. However, these policies are typically trivial to circumvent by registering an account with a false birth date, and a significant number of children aged under 13 join such sites anyway. Social networking services for younger children, which claim to provide better levels of protection for children, also exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2010/10/11/social-networks-children/ |title=5 Fun and Safe Social Networks for Children |date=11 October 2010 |access-date=7 December 2014 |website=[[Mashable]] |last=Kessler |first=Sarah |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220082237/http://mashable.com/2010/10/11/social-networks-children/ |archive-date=20 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Internet has been a major outlet for leisure activity since its inception, with entertaining [[social experiment]]s such as [[Multi-user dungeon|MUD]]s and [[MOO]]s being conducted on university servers, and humor-related [[Usenet]] groups receiving much traffic.&lt;ref name="StudFiles"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Communication in our life |url=https://studfile.net/preview/2987063/ |access-date=2023-05-16 |website=StudFiles |language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[Internet forums]] have sections devoted to games and funny videos.&lt;ref name="StudFiles" /&gt; The [[Internet pornography]] and [[online gambling]] industries have taken advantage of the World Wide Web. Although many governments have attempted to restrict both industries' use of the Internet, in general, this has failed to stop their widespread popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Business/SmallBiz/story?id=4151592|title=Do It Yourself!

Another area of leisure activity on the Internet is [[multiplayer gaming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://internetgames.about.com/od/gamingnews/a/trendsdecade.htm|title=Top Online Game Trends of the Decade|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929074221/http://internetgames.about.com/od/gamingnews/a/trendsdecade.htm |archive-date=29 September 2011|first=Dave|last=Spohn|website=About.com|date=15 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of recreation creates communities, where people of all ages and origins enjoy the fast-paced world of multiplayer games. These range from [[MMORPG]] to [[first-person shooter]]s, from [[role-playing video game]]s to [[online gambling]]. While online gaming has been around since the 1970s, modern modes of online gaming began with subscription services such as [[GameSpy Arcade|GameSpy]] and [[MPlayer.com|MPlayer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://internetgames.about.com/od/gamingnews/a/timeline.htm|title=Internet Game Timeline: 1963–2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060425091409/http://internetgames.about.com/od/gamingnews/a/timeline.htm|archive-date=25 April 2006|first=Dave|last=Spohn|website=About.com|date=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-subscribers were limited to certain types of game play or certain games. Many people use the Internet to access and download music, movies and other works for their enjoyment and relaxation. Free and fee-based services exist for all of these activities, using centralized servers and distributed peer-to-peer technologies. Some of these sources exercise more care with respect to the original artists' copyrights than others.

Internet usage has been correlated to users' loneliness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Carole Hughes |author2=Boston College |url=https://www2.bc.edu/~hughesc/abstract.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151107031736/https://www2.bc.edu/~hughesc/abstract.html |archive-date=7 November 2015 |title=The Relationship Between Internet Use and Loneliness Among College Students |publisher=Boston College |access-date=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lonely people tend to use the Internet as an outlet for their feelings and to share their stories with others, such as in the "[[I am lonely will anyone speak to me]]" thread. A 2017 book claimed that the Internet consolidates most aspects of human endeavor into singular arenas of which all of humanity are potential members and competitors, with fundamentally negative [[Digital media use and mental health|impacts on mental health]] as a result. While successes in each field of activity are pervasively visible and trumpeted, they are reserved for an extremely thin sliver of the world's most exceptional, leaving everyone else behind. Whereas, before the Internet, expectations of success in any field were supported by reasonable probabilities of achievement at the village, suburb, city or even state level, the same expectations in the Internet world are virtually certain to bring disappointment today: there is always someone else, somewhere on the planet, who can do better and take the now one-and-only top spot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barker|first=Eric|title=Barking Up the Wrong Tree|publisher=HarperCollins|date=2017|isbn=978-0-06-241604-9|pages=235–236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cybersectarianism]] is a new organizational form that involves, "highly dispersed small groups of practitioners that may remain largely anonymous within the larger social context and operate in relative secrecy, while still linked remotely to a larger network of believers who share a set of practices and texts, and often a common devotion to a particular leader. Overseas supporters provide funding and support; domestic practitioners distribute tracts, participate in acts of resistance, and share information on the internal situation with outsiders. Collectively, members and practitioners of such sects construct viable virtual communities of faith, exchanging personal testimonies and engaging in the collective study via email, online chat rooms, and web-based message boards."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Patricia M.|last=Thornton|chapter=The New Cybersects: Resistance and Repression in the Reform era|editor1-first=Elizabeth |editor1-last=Perry|editor2-first=Mark|editor2-last=Selden|title=Chinese Society: Change, Conflict and Resistance|edition=2|location=London and New York|publisher=Routledge|year=2003|pages=149–150|isbn=978-0-415-56074-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the British government has raised concerns about the prospect of young British Muslims being indoctrinated into Islamic extremism by material on the Internet, being persuaded to join [[terrorist]] groups such as the so-called "[[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]]", and then potentially committing acts of terrorism on returning to Britain after fighting in Syria or Iraq.

=== Electronic business ===
{{see also|Commercialization of the Internet}}
[[Electronic business]] (''e-business'') encompasses business processes spanning the entire [[value chain]]: purchasing, [[supply chain management]], [[marketing]], [[sales]], [[customer]] service, and business relationship. [[E-commerce]] seeks to add revenue streams using the Internet to build and enhance relationships with clients and partners. According to [[International Data Corporation]], the size of worldwide e-commerce, when global business-to-business and -consumer transactions are combined, equate to $16&amp;nbsp;trillion for 2013. A report by Oxford Economics added those two together to estimate the total size of the [[digital economy]] at $20.4&amp;nbsp;trillion, equivalent to roughly 13.8% of global sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myclouddoor.com/web/documents/The%20New%20Digital%20Economy.pdf|title=The New Digital Economy: How it will transform business|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706101452/http://www.myclouddoor.com/web/documents/The%20New%20Digital%20Economy.pdf |archive-date=6 July 2014|website=Oxford Economics|date=2 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While much has been written of the economic advantages of [[electronic commerce|Internet-enabled commerce]], there is also evidence that some aspects of the Internet such as maps and location-aware services may serve to reinforce [[economic inequality]] and the [[digital divide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How the Internet Reinforces Inequality in the Real World |work=The Atlantic |author=Badger, Emily |date=6 February 2013 |access-date=13 February 2013 |url=http://www.theatlanticcities.com/technology/2013/02/how-internet-reinforces-inequality-real-world/4602/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211095334/http://www.theatlanticcities.com/technology/2013/02/how-internet-reinforces-inequality-real-world/4602/ |archive-date=11 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Electronic commerce may be responsible for [[Consolidation (business)|consolidation]] and the decline of [[mom-and-pop]], [[brick and mortar]] businesses resulting in increases in [[income inequality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/e-commerce-will-make-the-shopping-mall-a-retail-wasteland/|title=E-commerce will make the shopping mall a retail wasteland|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130219011301/http://www.zdnet.com/e-commerce-will-make-the-shopping-mall-a-retail-wasteland-7000009960/|archive-date=19 February 2013|website=ZDNet|url-status=live|date=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comscore.com/Insights/Press_Releases/2012/12/Free_Shipping_Day_Promotion_Spurs_Late-Season_Online_Spending_Surge|title='Free Shipping Day' Promotion Spurs Late-Season Online Spending Surge, Improving Season-to-Date Growth Rate to 16 Percent vs. Year Ago|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128191411/http://www.comscore.com/Insights/Press_Releases/2012/12/Free_Shipping_Day_Promotion_Spurs_Late-Season_Online_Spending_Surge |archive-date=28 January 2013|website=Comscore|date=23 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theatlanticcities.com/jobs-and-economy/2012/12/death-american-shopping-mall/4252/|title=The Death of the American Shopping Mall|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215044619/http://www.theatlanticcities.com/jobs-and-economy/2012/12/death-american-shopping-mall/4252/ |archive-date=15 February 2013|website=The Atlantic – Cities|date=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author [[Andrew Keen]], a long-time critic of the social transformations caused by the Internet, has focused on the economic effects of consolidation from Internet businesses. Keen cites a 2013 [[Institute for Local Self-Reliance]] report saying brick-and-mortar retailers employ 47 people for every $10&amp;nbsp;million in sales while Amazon employs only 14. Similarly, the 700-employee room rental start-up [[Airbnb]] was valued at $10&amp;nbsp;billion in 2014, about half as much as [[Hilton Worldwide]], which employs 152,000 people. At that time, [[Uber]] employed 1,000 full-time employees and was valued at $18.2&amp;nbsp;billion, about the same valuation as [[Avis Rent a Car]] and [[The Hertz Corporation]] combined, which together employed almost 60,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last1=Harris |first1=Michael |title=Book review: 'The Internet Is Not the Answer' by Andrew Keen |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/book-review-the-internet-is-not-the-answer-by-andrew-keen/2015/01/02/8627999a-7973-11e4-9a27-6fdbc612bff8_story.html |access-date=25 January 2015 |newspaper=The Washington Post|date=2 January 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120000258/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/book-review-the-internet-is-not-the-answer-by-andrew-keen/2015/01/02/8627999a-7973-11e4-9a27-6fdbc612bff8_story.html |archive-date=20 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Remote work===
[[Remote work]] is facilitated by tools such as [[groupware]], [[virtual private networks]], [[conference calling]], [[videotelephony]], and VoIP so that work may be performed from any location, most conveniently the worker's home. It can be efficient and useful for companies as it allows workers to communicate over long distances, saving significant amounts of travel time and cost. More workers have adequate bandwidth at home to use these tools to link their home to their corporate [[intranet]] and internal communication networks.

The Internet has achieved new relevance as a political tool. The presidential campaign of [[Howard Dean]] in 2004 in the United States was notable for its success in soliciting donation via the Internet.

Many have understood the Internet as an extension of the [[Jürgen Habermas|Habermasian]] notion of the ''[[public sphere]]'', observing how network communication technologies provide something like a global civic forum.

=== Philanthropy ===
The spread of low-cost Internet access in developing countries has opened up new possibilities for [[Social peer-to-peer processes|peer-to-peer]] charities, which allow individuals to contribute small amounts to charitable projects for other individuals. Websites, such as [[DonorsChoose]] and [[GlobalGiving]], allow small-scale donors to direct funds to individual projects of their choice. A popular twist on Internet-based philanthropy is the use of [[peer-to-peer lending]] for charitable purposes. [[Kiva (organization)|Kiva]] pioneered this concept in 2005, offering the first web-based service to publish individual loan profiles for funding. Kiva raises funds for local intermediary [[microfinance]] organizations that post stories and updates on behalf of the borrowers. Lenders can contribute as little as $25 to loans of their choice and receive their money back as borrowers repay. Kiva falls short of being a pure peer-to-peer charity, in that loans are disbursed before being funded by lenders and borrowers do not communicate with lenders themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.cgdev.org/open_book/2009/10/kiva-is-not-quite-what-it-seems.php|title=Kiva Is Not Quite What It Seems|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210045011/http://blogs.cgdev.org/open_book/2009/10/kiva-is-not-quite-what-it-seems.php|archive-date=10 February 2010|first=David|last=Roodman|website=Center for Global Development|date=2 October 2009|access-date=16 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Strom |first=Stephanie |title=Confusion on Where Money Lent via Kiva Goes |work=The New York Times |page=6 |date=9 November 2009 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/09/business/global/09kiva.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170129225155/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/09/business/global/09kiva.html |archive-date=29 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malware===
[[Malware]] is malicious software used and distributed via the Internet. It includes [[computer virus]]es which are copied with the help of humans, [[computer worm]]s which copy themselves automatically, software for [[denial of service attack]]s, [[ransomware]], [[botnet]]s, and [[spyware]] that reports on the activity and typing of users.

Computers communicate over the Internet by breaking up messages (emails, images, videos, web pages, files, etc.) into small chunks called "packets", which are routed through a network of computers, until they reach their destination, where they are assembled back into a complete "message" again. [[Packet Capture Appliance]] intercepts these packets as they are traveling through the network, in order to examine their contents using other programs. A packet capture is an information ''gathering'' tool, but not an ''analysis'' tool. That is it gathers "messages" but it does not analyze them and figure out what they mean. Other programs are needed to perform [[traffic analysis]] and sift through intercepted data looking for important/useful information. Under the [[Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act]] all U.S. telecommunications providers are required to install packet sniffing technology to allow Federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies to intercept all of their customers' [[broadband Internet]] and VoIP traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baller.com/pdfs/ACE.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120907032500/http://www.baller.com/pdfs/ACE.pdf|title=American Council on Education vs. FCC, Decision, United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|date=9 June 2006|access-date=8 September 2013|archive-date=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The large amount of data gathered from packet capture requires surveillance software that filters and reports relevant information, such as the use of certain words or phrases, the access to certain types of web sites, or communicating via email or chat with certain parties.&lt;ref name="usatoday-chatroom"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/surveillance/2004-10-11-chatroom-surv_x.htm|title=Government funds chat room surveillance research|last=Hill|first=Michael|date=11 October 2004|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=USA Today|access-date=19 March 2009|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100511220550/http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/surveillance/2004-10-11-chatroom-surv_x.htm|archive-date=11 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agencies, such as the [[Information Awareness Office]], [[NSA]], [[GCHQ]] and the [[FBI]], spend billions of dollars per year to develop, purchase, implement, and operate systems for interception and analysis of data.&lt;ref name="zdnet-fbi"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9595_22-151059.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407040227/http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9595_22-151059.html|title=FBI turns to broad new wiretap method|last=McCullagh|first=Declan|date=30 January 2007|work=ZDNet News|access-date=13 March 2009|archive-date=7 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar systems are operated by [[Ministry of Intelligence and National Security of Iran|Iranian secret police]] to identify and suppress dissidents.

Some governments, such as those of [[Burma]], [[Iran]], [[Censorship in North Korea|North Korea]], [[Censorship in China|Mainland China]], [[Saudi Arabia]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]], restrict access to content on the Internet within their territories, especially to political and religious content, with domain name and keyword filters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=12187|title=Access Controlled: The Shaping of Power, Rights, and Rule in Cyberspace|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604102753/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=12187 |archive-date=4 June 2011|first1=Ronald J.|last1=Deibert|first2=John G.|last2=Palfrey|first3=Rafal|last3=Rohozinski|first4=Jonathan|last4=Zittrain|publisher=MIT Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-262-51435-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Norway, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden, major Internet service providers have voluntarily agreed to restrict access to sites listed by authorities. While this list of forbidden resources is supposed to contain only known child pornography sites, the content of the list is secret.&lt;ref name="The Register"&gt;{{cite web|title=Finland censors anti-censorship site |work=[[The Register]] |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/02/18/finnish_policy_censor_activist/ |date=18 February 2008 |access-date=19 February 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220075300/https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/02/18/finnish_policy_censor_activist/ |archive-date=20 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many countries, including the United States, have enacted laws against the possession or distribution of certain material, such as [[child pornography]], via the Internet but do not mandate filter software. Many free or commercially available software programs, called [[content-control software]] are available to users to block offensive websites on individual computers or networks in order to limit access by children to pornographic material or depiction of violence.

== Performance ==
As the Internet is a heterogeneous network, its physical characteristics, including, for example the [[Bit rate|data transfer rates]] of connections, vary widely. It exhibits [[Emergence#World Wide Web and the Internet|emergent phenomena]] that depend on its large-scale organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Albert |first1=Réka |last2=Jeong |first2=Hawoong |last3=Barabási |first3=Albert-László |s2cid=4419938 |title=Diameter of the World-Wide Web |journal=Nature |date=9 September 1999 |volume=401 |issue=6749 |pages=130–131 |doi=10.1038/43601|arxiv=cond-mat/9907038 |bibcode=1999Natur.401..130A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traffic volume===
{{Latest Global Internet traffic}}
The volume of [[Internet traffic]] is difficult to measure because no single point of measurement exists in the multi-tiered, non-hierarchical topology. Traffic data may be estimated from the aggregate volume through the peering points of the [[Tier 1 network]] providers, but traffic that stays local in large provider networks may not be accounted for.

=== Outages ===
An [[Internet blackout]] or outage can be caused by local signaling interruptions. Disruptions of [[submarine communications cable]]s may cause blackouts or slowdowns to large areas, such as in the [[2008 submarine cable disruption]]. Less-developed countries are more vulnerable due to the small number of high-capacity links. Land cables are also vulnerable, as in 2011 when a woman digging for scrap metal severed most connectivity for the nation of Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/06/georgian-woman-cuts-web-access |title=Georgian woman cuts off web access to whole of Armenia |date=6 April 2011 |access-date=11 April 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130825075603/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/06/georgian-woman-cuts-web-access |archive-date=25 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Internet blackouts affecting almost entire countries can be achieved by governments as a form of [[Internet censorship]], as in the blockage of the [[Internet in Egypt]], whereby approximately 93%&lt;ref name="renesys1"&gt;{{cite web| last =Cowie| first =James| title =Egypt Leaves the Internet| publisher =Renesys| url =http://www.renesys.com/blog/2011/01/egypt-leaves-the-internet.shtml| access-date =28 January 2011| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20110128080518/http://www.renesys.com/blog/2011/01/egypt-leaves-the-internet.shtml| archive-date =28 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; of networks were without access in 2011 in an attempt to stop mobilization for [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011|anti-government protests]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-12306041 |work=BBC News |title=Egypt severs internet connection amid growing unrest |date=28 January 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123164134/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-12306041 |archive-date=23 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy use ===
Estimates of the Internet's [[electricity usage]] have been the subject of controversy, according to a 2014 peer-reviewed research paper that found claims differing by a factor of 20,000 published in the literature during the preceding decade, ranging from 0.0064 [[kilowatt hour]]s per gigabyte transferred (kWh/GB) to 136 kWh/GB.&lt;ref name="Environmental Impact Assessment Review"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Coroama|first1=Vlad C.|last2=Hilty|first2=Lorenz M.|date=February 2014|title=Assessing Internet energy intensity: A review of methods and results|url=http://publicationslist.org/data/lorenz.hilty/ref-218/2014_Coroama_Hilty_Assessing_Internet_Energy_Intensity_AAM.pdf|journal=Environmental Impact Assessment Review|language=en|volume=45|pages=63–68|doi=10.1016/j.eiar.2013.12.004|bibcode=2014EIARv..45...63C |access-date=9 March 2020|archive-date=23 September 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200923042203/http://publicationslist.org/data/lorenz.hilty/ref-218/2014_Coroama_Hilty_Assessing_Internet_Energy_Intensity_AAM.pdf|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers attributed these discrepancies mainly to the year of reference (i.e. whether efficiency gains over time had been taken into account) and to whether "end devices such as [[personal computer]]s and servers are included" in the analysis.&lt;ref name="Environmental Impact Assessment Review" /&gt;

In 2011, academic researchers estimated the overall [[energy use]]d by the Internet to be between 170 and 307 [[gigawatt|GW]], less than two percent of the energy used by humanity. This estimate included the energy needed to build, operate, and periodically replace the estimated 750&amp;nbsp;million [[laptop]]s, a billion [[smart phone]]s and 100&amp;nbsp;million servers worldwide as well as the energy that routers, [[cell tower]]s, [[optical switch]]es, [[Wi-Fi]] transmitters and [[cloud storage]] devices use when transmitting [[Internet traffic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jim|last=Giles|title=Internet responsible for 2 per cent of global energy usage|website=New Scientist|date=26 October 2011|url=http://www.newscientist.com/blogs/onepercent/2011/10/307-gw-the-maximum-energy-the.html |archive-date=1 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141001113334/http://www.newscientist.com/blogs/onepercent/2011/10/307-gw-the-maximum-energy-the.html}},&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=http://conferences.sigcomm.org/hotnets/2011/papers/hotnetsX-final56.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810075940/http://conferences.sigcomm.org/hotnets/2011/papers/hotnetsX-final56.pdf |archive-date=10 August 2014|first1=Barath|last1=Raghavan|first2=Justin|last2=Ma|title=Proceedings of the 10th ACM Workshop on Hot Topics in Networks |chapter=The energy and emergy of the internet |date=14 November 2011|pages=1–6|location=Cambridge, MA.|publisher=ACM SIGCOMM|doi=10.1145/2070562.2070571|isbn=978-1-4503-1059-8|s2cid=6125953}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a non-peer-reviewed study published in 2018 by [[The Shift Project]] (a French think tank funded by corporate sponsors), nearly 4% of global [[carbon dioxide emissions|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions]] could be attributed to global [[data transfer]] and the necessary infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/is-netflix-bad-for-the-environment-how-streaming-video-contributes-to-climate-change/a-49556716|title=Is Netflix bad for the environment?

{{Internet history timeline}}

The '''Internet Protocol''' ('''IP''') is the [[network layer]] [[communications protocol]] in the [[Internet protocol suite]] for relaying [[datagram]]s across network boundaries. Its [[routing]] function enables [[internetworking]], and essentially establishes the [[Internet]].

IP has the task of delivering [[Packet (information technology)|packets]] from the source [[Host (network)|host]] to the destination host solely based on the [[IP address]]es in the packet [[Header (computing)|headers]]. For this purpose, IP defines packet structures that [[encapsulation (networking)|encapsulate]] the data to be delivered. It also defines addressing methods that are used to label the datagram with source and destination information.
IP was the [[connectionless]] datagram service in the original ''[[Transmission Control Program]]'' introduced by [[Vint Cerf]] and [[Bob Kahn]] in 1974, which was complemented by a [[connection-oriented]] service that became the basis for the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP). The Internet protocol suite is therefore often referred to as ''TCP/IP''.

The first major version of IP, [[Internet Protocol version 4]] (IPv4), is the dominant protocol of the Internet. Its successor is [[Internet Protocol version 6]] (IPv6), which has been in increasing [[IPv6 deployment|deployment]] on the public Internet since around 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report|publisher=OECD|date=2014-11-06|title=The Economics of Transition to Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6)|series=OECD Digital Economy Papers|url=https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/science-and-technology/the-economics-of-transition-to-internet-protocol-version-6-ipv6_5jxt46d07bhc-en|language=en|doi=10.1787/5jxt46d07bhc-en|doi-access=free|access-date=2020-12-04|archive-date=2021-03-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210307213313/https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/science-and-technology/the-economics-of-transition-to-internet-protocol-version-6-ipv6_5jxt46d07bhc-en|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
[[File:UDP encapsulation.svg|thumb|260px|Encapsulation of application data carried by [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] to a link protocol frame]]
The Internet Protocol is responsible for addressing [[host interface]]s, encapsulating data into datagrams (including [[IP fragmentation|fragmentation and reassembly]]) and routing datagrams from a source host interface to a destination host interface across one or more IP networks.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.tcpipguide.com/free/t_IPFunctions.htm |title=The TCP/IP Guide |author=Charles M. Kozierok |access-date=2017-07-22 |archive-date=2019-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190620010402/http://www.tcpipguide.com/free/t_IPFunctions.htm |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;''' For these purposes, the Internet Protocol defines the format of packets and provides an addressing system.

Each datagram has two components: a [[Header (computing)|header]] and a [[Payload (computing)|payload]]. The [[IP header]] includes a source IP address, a destination IP address, and other metadata needed to route and deliver the datagram. The payload is the data that is transported. This method of nesting the data payload in a packet with a header is called encapsulation.

IP addressing entails the assignment of IP addresses and associated parameters to host interfaces. The address space is divided into [[subnet]]s, involving the designation of network prefixes. IP routing is performed by all hosts, as well as [[Router (computing)|routers]], whose main function is to transport packets across network boundaries. Routers communicate with one another via specially designed [[routing protocol]]s, either [[interior gateway protocol]]s or [[exterior gateway protocol]]s, as needed for the topology of the network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=IP Technologies and Migration — EITC|url=http://www.eitc.org/research-opportunities/future-internet-and-optical-quantum-communications/internet-networks-and-tcp-ip/ip-technologies-and-migration|access-date=2020-12-04|website=www.eitc.org|archive-date=2021-01-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210105023938/http://www.eitc.org/research-opportunities/future-internet-and-optical-quantum-communications/internet-networks-and-tcp-ip/ip-technologies-and-migration|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:First Internet Demonstration, 1977.jpg|thumb|right|First Internet demonstration, linking the [[ARPANET]], [[PRNET]], and [[SATNET]] on November 22, 1977]]
In May 1974, the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) published a paper entitled "A Protocol for Packet Network Intercommunication".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Cerf|first1=V.|last2=Kahn|first2=R.|date=1974|title=A Protocol for Packet Network Intercommunication|url=https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall06/cos561/papers/cerf74.pdf|journal=IEEE Transactions on Communications|volume=22|issue=5|pages=637–648|doi=10.1109/TCOM.1974.1092259|issn=1558-0857|quote=The authors wish to thank a number of colleagues for helpful comments during early discussions of international network protocols, especially R.

A central control component of this model was the Transmission Control Program that incorporated both connection-oriented links and datagram services between hosts. The monolithic Transmission Control Program was later divided into a modular architecture consisting of the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] and [[User Datagram Protocol]] at the [[transport layer]] and the Internet Protocol at the [[internet layer]]. The model became known as the ''Department of Defense (DoD) Internet Model'' and ''[[Internet protocol suite]]'', and informally as ''TCP/IP''.

IP versions 1 to 3 were experimental versions, designed between 1973 and 1978.&lt;ref name="Coty"&gt;{{cite web |author=Stephen Coty |date=2011-02-11 |title=Where is IPv1, 2, 3, and 5? |url=https://blog.alertlogic.com/blog/where-is-ipv1,-2,-3,and-5/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200802011845/https://blog.alertlogic.com/blog/where-is-ipv1,-2,-3,and-5/ |archive-date=2020-08-02 |access-date=2020-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Versions 2 and 3 supported variable-length addresses ranging between 1 and 16 octets (between 8 and 128 bits).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite IETF |last1=Postel |first1=Jonathan B. |date=February 1978 |title=Draft Internetwork Protocol Specification Version 2 |ien=28 |autolink=no |url=https://www.rfc-editor.org/ien/ien28.pdf |website=RFC Editor |access-date=6 October 2022 }} {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190516090051/https://www.rfc-editor.org/ien/ien28.pdf |date=16 May 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An early draft of version 4 supported variable-length addresses of up to 256 octets (up to 2048 bits)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite IETF |last1=Postel |first1=Jonathan B. |date=June 1978 |title=Internetwork Protocol Specification Version 4 |ien=41 |autolink=no |url=https://www.rfc-editor.org/ien/ien41.pdf |website=RFC Editor |access-date=11 February 2024 }} {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190516090053/http://www.rfc-editor.org/ien/ien41.pdf |date=16 May 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but this was later abandoned in favor of a fixed-size 32-bit address in the final version of [[IPv4]]. This remains the dominant internetworking protocol in use in the [[Internet Layer]]; the number 4 identifies the protocol version, carried in every IP datagram. IPv4 is defined in {{IETF RFC|791}} (1981).

Version number 5 was used by the [[Internet Stream Protocol]], an experimental streaming protocol that was not adopted.&lt;ref name="Coty"/&gt;

The successor to IPv4 is [[IPv6]]. IPv6 was a result of several years of experimentation and dialog during which various protocol models were proposed, such as TP/IX ({{IETF RFC|1475}}), PIP ({{IETF RFC|1621}}) and TUBA (TCP and UDP with Bigger Addresses, {{IETF RFC|1347}}). Its most prominent difference from version 4 is the size of the addresses. While IPv4 uses [[32 bits]] for addressing, yielding c. 4.3 [[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]] ({{val|4.3|e=9}}) addresses, IPv6 uses [[128-bit]] addresses providing c. {{val|3.4|e=38}} addresses. Although adoption of IPv6 has been slow, {{as of|2023|01|lc=yes}}, most countries in the world show significant adoption of IPv6,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=IPv6 Adoption in 2021|url=https://labs.ripe.net/author/stephen_strowes/ipv6-adoption-in-2021/|first1=Stephen|last1=Strowes|date=4 Jun 2021|access-date=2021-09-20|website=RIPE Labs|language=en-US|archive-date=2021-09-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210920213008/https://labs.ripe.net/author/stephen_strowes/ipv6-adoption-in-2021/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; with over 41% of Google's traffic being carried over IPv6 connections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=IPv6 |url=https://www.google.com/intl/en/ipv6/statistics.html#tab=ipv6-adoption |access-date=2023-05-19 |website=Google |archive-date=2020-07-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200714184705/https://www.google.com/intl/en/ipv6/statistics.html#tab=ipv6-adoption |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The assignment of the new protocol as IPv6 was uncertain until due diligence assured that IPv6 had not been used previously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mulligan|first1=Geoff|title=It was almost IPv7|url=http://archive.oreilly.com/cs/user/view/cs_msg/25036|website=O'Reilly |access-date=4 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705060055/http://archive.oreilly.com/cs/user/view/cs_msg/25036|archive-date=5 July 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Internet Layer protocols have been assigned version numbers,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iana.org/assignments/version-numbers/version-numbers.xhtml|title=IP Version Numbers|website=Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|access-date=2019-07-25|archive-date=2019-01-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190118144623/https://www.iana.org/assignments/version-numbers/version-numbers.xhtml|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as 7 (''IP/TX''), 8 and 9 (''historic''). Notably, on April 1, 1994, the [[IETF]] published an [[April Fools' Day RfC]] about IPv9.&lt;ref&gt;{{IETF RFC|1606}}: ''A Historical Perspective On The Usage Of IP Version 9''. April 1, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; IPv9 was also used in an alternate proposed address space expansion called TUBA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite IETF |rfc=1347 |title=TCP and UDP with Bigger Addresses (TUBA), A Simple Proposal for Internet Addressing and Routing |author=Ross Callon |date=June 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2004 Chinese proposal for [[IPv9 (China)|an IPv9 protocol]] appears to be unrelated to all of these, and is not endorsed by the IETF.

==Reliability==
The design of the Internet protocol suite adheres to the [[end-to-end principle]], a concept adapted from the [[CYCLADES]] project. Under the end-to-end principle, the network infrastructure is considered inherently unreliable at any single network element or transmission medium and is dynamic in terms of the availability of links and nodes. No central monitoring or performance measurement facility exists that tracks or maintains the state of the network. For the benefit of reducing [[network complexity]], the intelligence in the network is located in the [[end node]]s.

As a consequence of this design, the Internet Protocol only provides [[best-effort delivery]] and its service is characterized as [[Reliability (computer networking)|unreliable]]. In network architectural parlance, it is a [[connectionless protocol]], in contrast to [[connection-oriented communication]]. Various fault conditions may occur, such as [[data corruption]], [[packet loss]] and duplication. Because routing is dynamic, meaning every packet is treated independently, and because the network maintains no state based on the path of prior packets, different packets may be routed to the same destination via different paths, resulting in [[out-of-order delivery]] to the receiver.

All fault conditions in the network must be detected and compensated by the participating end nodes. The [[upper layer protocol]]s of the Internet protocol suite are responsible for resolving reliability issues. For example, a host may [[Data buffer|buffer]] network data to ensure correct ordering before the data is delivered to an application.

IPv4 provides safeguards to ensure that the header of an IP packet is error-free. A routing node discards packets that fail a header [[checksum]] test. Although the [[Internet Control Message Protocol]] (ICMP) provides notification of errors, a routing node is not required to notify either end node of errors. IPv6, by contrast, operates without header checksums, since current [[link layer]] technology is assumed to provide sufficient error detection.&lt;ref&gt;{{IETF RFC|1726}} section 6.2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{IETF RFC|2460}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Link capacity and capability==
The dynamic nature of the Internet and the diversity of its components provide no guarantee that any particular path is actually capable of, or suitable for, performing the data transmission requested. One of the technical constraints is the size of data packets possible on a given link. Facilities exist to examine the [[maximum transmission unit]] (MTU) size of the local link and [[Path MTU Discovery]] can be used for the entire intended path to the destination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Rishabh|first=Anand|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XDJlDwAAQBAJ&amp;q=The+dynamic+nature+of+the+Internet+and+the+diversity+of+its+components+provide+no+guarantee+that+any+particular+path+is+actually+capable+of%2C+or+suitable+for%2C+performing+the+data+transmission+requested.+One+of+the+technical+constraints+is+the+size+of+data+packets+possible+on+a+given+link.+Facilities+exist+to+examine+the+maximum+transmission+unit+%28MTU%29+size+of+the+local+link+and+Path+MTU+Discovery+can+be+used+for+the+entire+intended+path+to+the+destination.&amp;pg=PA332|title=Wireless Communication|date=2012|publisher=S.

The IPv4 internetworking layer automatically [[IP fragmentation|fragments]] a datagram into smaller units for transmission when the link MTU is exceeded. IP provides re-ordering of fragments received out of order.&lt;ref&gt;Siyan, Karanjit. ''Inside TCP/IP'', New Riders Publishing, 1997. {{ISBN|1-56205-714-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; An IPv6 network does not perform fragmentation in network elements, but requires end hosts and higher-layer protocols to avoid exceeding the path MTU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=IPv6 Fragmentation |author=Bill Cerveny |publisher=[[Arbor Networks]] |url=https://www.arbornetworks.com/blog/asert/ipv6-fragmentation/ |date=2011-07-25 |access-date=2016-09-10 |archive-date=2016-09-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916162637/https://www.arbornetworks.com/blog/asert/ipv6-fragmentation/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) is an example of a protocol that adjusts its segment size to be smaller than the MTU. The [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP) and ICMP disregard MTU size, thereby forcing IP to fragment oversized datagrams.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://community.broadcom.com/symantecenterprise/communities/community-home/librarydocuments/viewdocument?DocumentKey=03c598ea-e171-47c9-8035-753ccd8bb36e&amp;CommunityKey=1ecf5f55-9545-44d6-b0f4-4e4a7f5f5e68&amp;tab=librarydocuments|title = Basic Journey of a Packet|date = 2 November 2010|access-date = 4 May 2014|website = [[Broadcom#Symantec enterprise security|Symantec]]|publisher = [[NortonLifeLock|Symantec]]|last = Parker|first = Don|archive-date = 20 January 2022|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20220120044011/https://community.broadcom.com/symantecenterprise/communities/community-home/librarydocuments/viewdocument?DocumentKey=03c598ea-e171-47c9-8035-753ccd8bb36e&amp;CommunityKey=1ecf5f55-9545-44d6-b0f4-4e4a7f5f5e68&amp;tab=librarydocuments|url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Security==
During the design phase of the [[ARPANET]] and the early Internet, the security aspects and needs of a public, international network were not adequately anticipated.  Consequently, many Internet protocols exhibited vulnerabilities highlighted by network attacks and later security assessments. In 2008, a thorough security assessment and proposed mitigation of problems was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100211145721/http://www.cpni.gov.uk/Docs/InternetProtocol.pdf |archive-date=2010-02-11 |url=http://www.cpni.gov.uk/Docs/InternetProtocol.pdf |title=Security Assessment of the Internet Protocol |date=July 2008 |author= Fernando Gont |publisher=[[Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure|CPNI]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IETF has been pursuing further studies.&lt;ref name="RFC 6274"&gt;{{cite IETF |rfc=6274 |title=Security Assessment of the Internet Protocol version 4 |author=F.

A '''virtual community''' is a [[social network]] of individuals who connect through specific [[social media]], potentially crossing geographical and political boundaries in order to pursue mutual interests or goals. Some of the most pervasive virtual communities are [[online community|online communities]] operating under [[social networking service]]s.

[[Howard Rheingold]] discussed virtual communities in his book, ''[[The Virtual Community (book)|The Virtual Community]]'', published in 1993. The book's discussion ranges from Rheingold's adventures on [[The WELL]], [[computer-mediated communication]], social groups and information science. Technologies cited include [[Usenet]], [[Multi-user dungeon|MUD]]s (Multi-User Dungeon) and their derivatives [[MUSH]]es and [[MOO]]s, [[Internet Relay Chat]] (IRC), [[chat room]]s and [[electronic mailing list]]s. Rheingold also points out the potential benefits for personal psychological well-being, as well as for society at large, of belonging to a virtual community. At the same time, it showed that job engagement positively influences virtual communities of practice engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Haas|first1=Aurore|last2=Abonneau|first2=David|last3=Borzillo|first3=Stefano|last4=Guillaume|first4=Louis-Pierre|date=3 April 2021|title=Afraid of engagement?

Virtual communities all encourage interaction, sometimes focusing around a particular interest or just to communicate. Some virtual communities do both. Community members are allowed to interact over a shared passion through various means: [[Internet forum|message boards]], [[chat room]]s, [[social network]]ing World Wide Web sites, or virtual worlds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|author=Hof, R. D.|author2=Browder, S.|author3=Elstrom, P.|date=5 May 1997|title=hacking Communities|magazine=Business Week}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members usually become attached to the community world, logging in and out on sites all day every day, which can certainly become an addiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Ridings|first1=Catherine M.|last2=Gefen|first2=David|date=23 June 2006|title=Virtual Community Attraction: Why People Hang Out Online|url=https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1083-6101.2004.tb00229.x|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|volume=10|issue=1|pages=00|doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.2004.tb00229.x|s2cid=21854835|issn=1083-6101|access-date=18 November 2022|archive-date=17 January 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230117173521/https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/10/1/JCMC10110/4614455|url-status=live|url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
[[File:Virtual Meeting with Dr Fatih Birol (01012521) (50922442821).jpg|alt=an image of an ongoing virtual meeting as a medium of interaction in a virtual community|thumb|Exchange of information and support in a virtual space]]
The traditional definition of a community is of geographically circumscribed entity (neighborhoods, villages, etc.). Virtual communities are usually dispersed geographically, and therefore are not communities under the original definition. Some online communities are linked geographically, and are known as community websites. However, if one considers communities to simply possess boundaries of some sort between their members and non-members, then a virtual community is certainly a community.&lt;ref name="Pears-1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pears|first=Iain|date=1998|title=An Instance of the Fingerpost|location=London|publisher=Jonathan Cape}}&lt;/ref&gt; Virtual communities resemble real life ''[[communities]]'' in the sense that they both provide support, information, friendship and acceptance between strangers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wellman|first=B|year=1999|title=Networks in the global village: life in contemporary communities|publisher=Avalon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vhuOBRPS-pUC&amp;q=impacts+of+virtual+communities&amp;pg=PA331|isbn=9780813368214|access-date=4 November 2020|archive-date=12 May 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230512105935/https://books.google.com/books?id=vhuOBRPS-pUC&amp;q=impacts+of+virtual+communities&amp;pg=PA331|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in a virtual community space, users may be expected to feel a sense of belonging and a mutual attachment among the members that are in the space.

One of the most influential part about virtual communities is the opportunity to communicate through several media platforms or networks. Now that virtual communities exists, this had leveraged out the things we once did prior to virtual communities, such as postal services, fax machines, and even speaking on the telephone. Early research into the existence of media-based communities was concerned with the nature of [[virtual reality|reality]], whether communities actually could exist through the media, which could place virtual community research into the social sciences definition of ontology. In the seventeenth century, scholars associated with the [[Royal Society]] of London formed a community through the exchange of letters.&lt;ref name="Pears-1998"/&gt; "Community without propinquity", coined by urban planner [[Melvin Webber]] in 1963 and "community liberated", analyzed by [[Barry Wellman]] in 1979 began the modern era of thinking about non-local community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Webber|first=Melvin|year=1963|chapter=Order in Diversity: Community without Propinquity|pages=23–54|title=Cities and Space: The Future Use of Urban Land|editor=J.

==Purpose==
[[File:Platovterm1981.jpg|thumb|upright|A PLATO V terminal in 1981 displaying RankTrek application]]

Virtual communities are used for a variety of social and professional groups; interaction between community members vary from personal to purely formal. For example, an email distribution list could serve as a personal means of communicating with family and friends, and also formally to coordinate with coworkers.

=== User experience testing to determine social codes ===
[[User experience]] is the ultimate goal for the program or software used by an internet community, because user experience will determine the software's success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sieckenius de Souza|first1=Clarisse|last2=Preece|first2=Jenny|title=A framework for analyzing and understanding online communities|journal=Interacting with Computers|date=June 2004|volume=19|issue=3|pages=579–610}}&lt;/ref&gt; The software for social media pages or virtual communities is structured around the users' experience and designed specifically for online use.
User experience testing is utilized to reveal something about the personal experience of the human being using a product or system.&lt;ref name="Tullis-2016"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tullis|first1=Thomas|last2=Albert|first2=William|title=Measuring the User Experience: Collecting, Analyzing, and Presenting Usability Metrics|date=2016|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|location=Amsterdam|isbn=978-0-12-415781-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it comes to testing user experience in a software interface, three main characteristics are needed: a user who is engaged, a user who is interacting with a product or interface, and defining the users' experience in ways that are and observable or measurable.&lt;ref name="Tullis-2016" /&gt;
User experience metrics are based on a reliability and repeatability, using a consistent set of measurements to result in comparable outcomes. User experience metrics are based on user retention, using a consistent set of measurements to collect data on user experience. 
The widespread use of the Internet and virtual communities by millions of diverse users for socializing is a phenomenon that raises new issues for researchers and developers. The vast number and diversity of individuals participating in virtual communities worldwide makes it a challenge to test usability across platforms to ensure the best overall user experience.  Some well-established measures applied to the usability framework for online communities are speed of learning, productivity, user satisfaction, how much people remember using the software, and how many errors they make.&lt;ref name="Preece-2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Preece|first1=Jenny|title=Socialility and Usability in Online Communities: Determining and Measuring Success|journal=Behaviour &amp; Information Technology|date=2001|volume=20|issue=5|pages=347–356|doi=10.1080/01449290110084683|s2cid=14120302}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The human computer interactions that are measured during a usability experience test focus on the individuals rather than their social interactions in the online community. The success of online communities depend on the integration of usability and social semiotics. Usability testing metrics can be used to determine social codes by evaluating a user's habits when interacting with a program. Social codes are established and reinforced by the regular repetition of behavioral patterns.&lt;ref name="Chandler-2007"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chandler|first1=Daniel|title=Semiotics: The Basics|date=2007|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon, Oxon|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; People communicate their social identities or [[culture code]] through the work they do, the way they talk, the clothes they wear, their eating habits, domestic environments and possessions, and use of leisure time. Usability testing metrics can be used to determine social codes by evaluating a user's habits when interacting with a program. The information provided during a usability test can determine demographic factors and help define the semiotic social code. Dialogue and social interactions, support information design, navigation support, and accessibility are integral components specific to online communities. As virtual communities grow, so do the diversity of their users. However, the technologies are not made to be any more or less intuitive. Usability tests can ensure users are communicating effectively using social and semiotic codes while maintaining their social identities.&lt;ref name="Preece-2001" /&gt; Efficient communication requires a common set of signs in the minds of those seeking to communicate.&lt;ref name="Chandler-2007" /&gt; As technologies evolve and mature, they tend to be used by an increasingly diverse set of users. This kind of increasing complexity and evolution of technology does no necessarily mean that the technologies are becoming easier to use.&lt;ref name="Tullis-2016" /&gt; Usability testing in virtual communities can ensure users are communicating effectively through social and semiotic codes and maintenance of social realities and identities.&lt;ref name="Chandler-2007" /&gt;

==Effects==

===On health===
[[File:Virtual reality PTSD therapy.jpg|alt=an image of  an ongoing virtual therapy session for PTSD|thumb|A Virtual  therapy session for PTSD]]
Recent studies have looked into development of health related communities and their impact on those already suffering health issues. These forms of social networks allow for open conversation between individuals who are going through similar experiences, whether themselves or in their family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eysenbach|first=G|year=2008|title=The Impact of the Internet on Cancer Outcomes|journal=CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians|volume=53|issue=6|pages=356–371|doi=10.3322/canjclin.53.6.356|pmid=15224975|citeseerx=10.1.1.526.4309|s2cid=10192148}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such sites have so grown in popularity that now many health care providers form groups for their patients by providing web areas where one may direct questions to doctors. These sites prove especially useful when related to rare medical conditions. People with rare or debilitating disorders may not be able to access support groups in their physical community, thus online communities act as primary means for such support. Online health communities can serve as supportive outlets as they facilitate connecting with others who truly understand the disease, as well as offer more practical support, such as receiving help in adjusting to life with the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/04/04/135106113/patients-with-rare-diseases-connect-online|title=Web Communities Help Patients With Rare Diseases|website=NPR.org|publisher=NPR|access-date=10 July 2012|archive-date=18 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018152136/http://www.npr.org/2011/04/04/135106113/patients-with-rare-diseases-connect-online|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each patient on online health communities are on there for different reasons, as some may need quick answers to questions they have, or someone to talk to.Involvement in social communities of similar health interests has created a means for patients to develop a better understanding and behavior towards treatment and health practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neal|first1=L.|last2=Lindgagarrd|first2=G.|last3=Oakley|first3=K.|last4=Hansen|first4=D.|last5=Kogan|first5=S.|last6=Leimeister|first6=J.M.|last7=Selker|first7=T.|year=2006|title=Online Health Communities|journal=CHI|pages=444–447|url=http://www.uni-kassel.de/fb7/ibwl/leimeister/pub/JML_109.pdf|access-date=10 July 2012|archive-date=12 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712151749/http://www.uni-kassel.de/fb7/ibwl/leimeister/pub/JML_109.pdf|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cocciolo|first1=A.|last2=Mineo|first2=C.|last3=Meier|first3=E.|title=Using Online Social Networks to Build Healthy Communities: A Design-based Research Investigation|pages=1–10|url=http://www.thinkingprojects.org/bhc_paper.pdf|access-date=10 July 2012|archive-date=15 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015141134/http://www.thinkingprojects.org/bhc_paper.pdf|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these users could have very serious life-threatening issues which these personal contexts could become very helpful to these users, as the issues are very complex.&lt;ref name="Huh-2016"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Huh|first1=Jina|last2=Kwon|first2=Bum Chul|last3=Kim|first3=Sung-Hee|last4=Lee|first4=Sukwon|last5=Choo|first5=Jaegul|last6=Kim|first6=Jihoon|last7=Choi|first7=Min-Je|last8=Yi|first8=Ji Soo|date=1 October 2016|title=Personas in online health communities|journal=Journal of Biomedical Informatics|language=en|volume=63|pages=212–225|doi=10.1016/j.jbi.2016.08.019|pmid=27568913|pmc=5268468|issn=1532-0464}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patients increasingly use such outlets, as this is providing personalized and emotional support and information, that will help them and have a better experience.&lt;ref name="Huh-2016"/&gt; The extent to which these practices have effects on health are still being studied.

Studies on health networks have mostly been conducted on groups which typically suffer the most from extreme forms of  diseases, for example cancer patients, HIV patients, or patients with other life-threatening diseases. It is general knowledge that one participates in online communities to interact with society and develop relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cocciolo|first1=A.|last2=Mineo|first2=C.|last3=Meier|first3=E.|title=Using Online Social Networks to Build Healthy Communities: A Design-based Research Investigation|pages=1–10|url=http://www.thinkingprojects.org/bhc_paper.pdf|access-date=10 July 2012|archive-date=15 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015141134/http://www.thinkingprojects.org/bhc_paper.pdf|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Individuals who suffer from rare or severe illnesses are unable to meet physically because of distance or because it could be a risk to their health to leave a secure environment. Thus, they have turned to the internet.

Some studies have indicated that virtual communities can provide valuable benefits to their users. Online health-focused communities were shown to offer a unique form of emotional support that differed from event-based realities and informational support networks. Growing amounts of presented material show how online communities affect the health of their users.  Apparently the creation of health communities has a positive impact on those who are ill or in need of medical information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Communities and Technologies|pages=31–40|publisher=ACM|location=New York|year=2009|doi=10.1145/1556460.1556466|isbn=9781605587134|series=C&amp;T '09|citeseerx=10.1.1.589.9656|chapter=Supportive communication, sense of virtual community and health outcomes in online infertility groups|last1=Welbourne|first1=Jennifer L.|last2=Blanchard|first2=Anita L.|last3=Boughton|first3=Marla D.|s2cid=8243700}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===On civic participation===
[[File:Civic Engagement.jpg|alt=An image of young citizens involved in civic engagement|thumb|Young citizens involved in civic engagement]]

It was found that young individuals  are more bored with politics and history topics, and instead are more interested in celebrity dramas and topics. Young individuals claim that "voicing what you feel" does not mean "being heard", so they feel the need to not participate in these engagements, as they believe they are not being listened to anyway.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rheingold|first=Howard|date=2008|title="Using Participatory Media and Public Voice to Encourage Civic Engagement."

Networking sites act as a medium for expression and discourse about issues in specific user communities. Online content-sharing sites have made it easy for youth as well as others to not only express themselves and their ideas through digital media, but also connect with large networked communities. Within these spaces, young people are pushing the boundaries of traditional forms of engagement such as voting and joining political organizations and creating their own ways to discuss, connect, and act in their communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carvin|first=A.|date=1 December 2006|title=Understanding the impact of online communities on civic engagement|website=[[PBS]]|url=https://www.pbs.org/teachers/learning.now/2006/12/understanding_the_impact_of_on.html|access-date=17 September 2017|archive-date=2 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150102081959/http://www.pbs.org/teachers/learning.now/2006/12/understanding_the_impact_of_on.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civic engagement through [[online volunteering]] has shown to have positive effects on personal satisfaction and development. Some 84 percent of online volunteers found that their online volunteering experience had contributed to their personal development and learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unv.org/annual-report-2014/index.html|title=UNV Annual Report 2014, Innovation and Knowledge|access-date=28 June 2015|archive-date=24 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150624015400/http://www.unv.org/annual-report-2014/index.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===On communication===
In his book ''[[The Wealth of Networks]]'' from 2006, [[Yochai Benkler]] suggests that virtual communities would "come to represent a new form of human communal existence, providing new scope for building a shared experience of human interaction".&lt;ref name="Benkler-2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Benkler|first=Yochai|year=2006|title=The Wealth of Networks: How Social Production Transforms Markets and Freedom|url=http://www.benkler.org/Benkler_Wealth_Of_Networks_Chapter_10.pdf|access-date=26 November 2013|archive-date=10 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190910191017/http://www.benkler.org/Benkler_Wealth_Of_Networks_Chapter_10.pdf|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Benkler's prediction has not become entirely true, clearly communications and social relations are extremely complex within a virtual community. The two main effects that can be seen according to Benkler are a "thickening of preexisting relations with friends, family and neighbours" and the beginnings of the "emergence of greater scope for limited-purpose, loose relationships".&lt;ref name="Benkler-2006" /&gt; Despite being acknowledged as "loose" relationships, Benkler argues that they remain meaningful.

Previous concerns about the effects of Internet use on community and family fell into two categories: 1) sustained, intimate human relations "are critical to well-functioning human beings as a matter of psychological need" and 2) people with "[[social capital]]" are better off than those who lack it. It leads to better results in terms of political participation.&lt;ref name="Benkler-2006" /&gt; However, Benkler argues that unless Internet connections actually displace direct, unmediated, human contact, there is no basis to think that using the Internet will lead to a decline in those nourishing connections we need psychologically, or in the useful connections we make socially. Benkler continues to suggest that the nature of an individual changes over time, based on social practices and expectations. There is a shift from individuals who depend upon locally embedded, unmediated and stable social relationships to networked individuals who are more dependent upon their own combination of strong and weak ties across boundaries and weave their own fluid relationships. Manuel Castells calls this the "networked society".&lt;ref name="Benkler-2006" /&gt;

=== On identity ===
In 1997, [[MCI Communications]] released the "Anthem" advertisement, heralding the internet as a utopia without age, race, or gender. [[Lisa Nakamura]] argues in chapter 16 of her 2002 book ''After/image of identity: Gender, Technology, and Identity Politics'', that technology gives us iterations of our age, race and gender in virtual spaces, as opposed to them being fully extinguished. Nakamura uses a metaphor of "after-images" to describe the cultural phenomenon of expressing identity on the internet. The idea is that any performance of identity on the internet is simultaneously present and past-tense, "posthuman and projectionary", due to its immortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Nakamura|first=Lisa|title=After/Images of Identity: Gender, Technology, and Identity Politics|publisher=MIT Press|year=2002|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=121–131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sherry Turkle]], professor of Social Studies of Science and Technology at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], believes the internet is a place where actions of discrimination are less likely to occur. In her 1995 book ''Life on the Screen: Identity in the Age of the Internet'', she argues that discrimination is easier in reality as it is easier to identify as face value, what is contrary to one's norm. The internet allows for a more fluid expression of identity and thus people become more accepting of inconsistent personae within themselves and others. For these reasons, Turkle argues users existing in online spaces are less compelled to judge or compare themselves to their peers, allowing people in virtual settings an opportunity to gain a greater capacity for acknowledging diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Turkle|first=Sherry|title=Life on the Screen: Identity in the Age of the Internet|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=1995|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nakamura argues against this view, coining the term [[identity tourism]] in her 1999 article "Race In/For Cyberspace: Identity Tourism and Racial Passing on the Internet". Identity tourism, in the context of cyberspace, is a term used to the describe the phenomenon of users donning and doffing other-race and other-gender personae. Nakamura finds that performed behavior from these identity tourists often perpetuate stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Nakamura|first=Lisa|chapter=Race In/For Cyberspace: Identity Tourism and Racial Passing on the Internet|title=Works and Days: Essays in the Socio-Historical Dimensions of Literature &amp; the Arts|publisher=Allyn and Bacon|year=1999|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1998 book ''Communities in Cyberspace'', authors [[Mark A. Smith|Marc A. Smith]] and [[Peter Kollock]], perceives the interactions with strangers are based upon with whom we are speaking or interacting with. People use everything from clothes, voice, [[body language]], [[gesture]]s, and power to identify others, which plays a role with how they will speak or interact with them. Smith and Kollock believes that online interactions breaks away of all of the face-to-face gestures and signs that people tend to show in front of one another. Although this is difficult to do online, it also provides space to play with one's identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/edit/10.4324/9780203194959/communities-cyberspace-peter-kollock-marc-smith|title=Communities in Cyberspace|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|editor-last=Kollock|editor-first=Peter|doi=10.4324/9780203194959|isbn=9780203194959|s2cid=154281450|editor-last2=Smith|editor-first2=Marc|access-date=18 November 2022|archive-date=27 October 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221027153413/https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/edit/10.4324/9780203194959/communities-cyberspace-peter-kollock-marc-smith|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Gender ====
The gaming community is extremely vast and accessible to a wide variety of people, However, there are negative effects on the relationships "gamers" have with the medium when expressing identity of gender. [[Adrienne Shaw]] notes in her 2012 article "Do you identify as a gamer? Gender, race, sexuality, and gamer identity", that gender, perhaps subconsciously, plays a large role in identifying oneself as a "gamer".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shaw|first=Adrienne|date=2012|title=Do you identify as a gamer? Gender, race, sexuality, and gamer identity|journal=New Media &amp; Society|volume=14|issue=1|pages=28–44|doi=10.1177/1461444811410394|s2cid=206727217}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lisa Nakamura, representation in video games has become a problem, as the minority of players from different backgrounds who are not just the stereotyped white teen male gamer are not represented.&lt;ref name="Nakamura-2013"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Nakamura|first=Lisa|date=13 September 2013|title=Cybertypes|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9780203699188|doi=10.4324/9780203699188|isbn=9780203699188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

=== Internet-based ===
The explosive diffusion&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Porter|first=Constance Elise|date=1 November 2004|title=A Typology of Virtual Communities: a Multi-Disciplinary Foundation for Future Research|url=https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/10/1/JCMC1011/4614445|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|language=en|volume=10|issue=1|pages=00|doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.2004.tb00228.x|access-date=29 September 2019|archive-date=27 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191227145613/https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/10/1/JCMC1011/4614445|url-status=live|url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Internet since the mid-1990s fostered the proliferation of virtual communities in the form of social networking services and online communities. Virtual communities may synthesize [[Web 2.0]] technologies with the community, and therefore have been described as Community 2.0, although strong community bonds have been forged online since the early 1970s on timeshare systems like [[PLATO (computer system)|PLATO]] and later on [[Usenet]]. Online communities depend upon social interaction and exchange between users online. This interaction emphasizes the [[reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocity]] element of the unwritten [[social contract]] between community members.

===Internet message boards===
[[File:Phpbb 3.0 prosilver.png|thumb|An Internet forum powered by [[phpBB]]]]

An online [[Internet forum|message board]] is a forum where people can discuss thoughts or ideas on various topics or simply express an idea. Users may choose which thread, or board of discussion, they would like to read or contribute to. A user will start a discussion by making a post.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marone|first=Vittorio|year=2015|title="Keep in mind that I will be improving": The opening post as a request for absolution|journal=Online Journal of Communication and Media Technologies|volume=5|issue=1|pages=136–158|doi=10.29333/ojcmt/2499|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other users who choose to respond can follow the discussion by adding their own posts to that thread at any time. Unlike in spoken [[conversation]]s, message boards do not usually have instantaneous responses; users actively go to the website to check for responses.

Anyone can register to participate in an online message board. People can choose to participate in the virtual community, even if or when they choose not to contribute their thoughts and ideas. Unlike chat rooms, at least in practice, message boards can accommodate an almost infinite number of users.

Internet users' urges to talk to and reach out to strangers online is unlike those in real-life encounters where people are hesitant and often unwilling to step in to help strangers. Studies have shown that people are more likely to intervene when they are the only one in a situation. With Internet message boards, users at their computers are alone, which might contribute to their willingness to reach out. Another possible explanation is that people can withdraw from a situation much more easily online than off. They can simply click exit or log off, whereas they would have to find a physical exit and deal with the repercussions of trying to leave a situation in real life. The lack of status that is presented with an online identity also might encourage people, because, if one chooses to keep it private, there is no associated label of gender, age, ethnicity or lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wellman|first=B.|year=1999|title=Networks in the global village: life in contemporary communities|publisher=Avalon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vhuOBRPS-pUC&amp;q=impacts+of+virtual+communities&amp;pg=PA331|isbn=9780813368214|access-date=4 November 2020|archive-date=12 May 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230512105935/https://books.google.com/books?id=vhuOBRPS-pUC&amp;q=impacts+of+virtual+communities&amp;pg=PA331|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Online chat rooms===
[[File:Xaric screen shot.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|An example of an IRC chat session on Xaric, a text-based client. Shown are two IRC channels and a private conversation.]]

{{Original research|section|date=January 2016}}

Shortly after the rise of interest in message boards and forums, people started to want a way of communicating with their "communities" in real time. The downside to message boards was that people would have to wait until another user replied to their posting, which, with people all around the world in different time frames, could take a while. The development of online [[chat room]]s allowed people to talk to whoever was online at the same time they were. This way, messages were sent and online users could immediately respond.

The original development by [[CB Simulator|CompuServe CB]] hosted forty channels in which users could talk to one another in real time. The idea of forty different channels led to the idea of chat rooms that were specific to different topics. Users could choose to join an already existent chat room they found interesting, or start a new "room" if they found nothing to their liking. Real-time chatting was also brought into virtual games, where people could play against one another and also talk to one another through text. Now, chat rooms can be found on all sorts of topics, so that people can talk with others who share similar interests. Chat rooms are now provided by [[Internet Relay Chat]] (IRC) and other individual websites such as [[Yahoo!|Yahoo]], [[MSN]], and [[AOL]].

Chat room users communicate through text-based messaging. Most chat room providers are similar and include an input box, a message window, and a participant list. The input box is where users can type their text-based message to be sent to the providing server. The server will then transmit the message to the computers of anyone in the chat room so that it can be displayed in the message window. The message window allows the conversation to be tracked and usually places a time stamp once the message is posted. There is usually a list of the users who are currently in the room, so that people can see who is in their virtual community.

Users can communicate as if they are speaking to one another in real life. This "simulated reality" attribute makes it easy for users to form a virtual community, because chat rooms allow users to get to know one another as if they were meeting in real life. The individual "room" feature also makes it more likely that the people within a chat room share a similar interest; an interest that allows them to bond with one another and be willing to form a friendship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Phelps|first=Alan|title=How Chat Rooms Work|publisher=Smartcomputing.com|date=11 July 2010|url=http://www.smartcomputing.com/articles/archive/R0502/18R02/18R02.pdf|access-date=11 July 2010|archive-date=25 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225044723/http://www.smartcomputing.com/articles/archive/R0502/18R02/18R02.pdf|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/internet/social-networking/information/chat-room.htm|title=HowStuffWorks: How Chat Rooms Work|author=Roos, Dave|date=11 July 2010|access-date=23 August 2010|archive-date=15 August 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100815072450/http://computer.howstuffworks.com/internet/social-networking/information/chat-room.htm|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Virtual worlds===
{{Main|Virtual world}}
[[File:Party in Hyrule, Second Life, picture 2.png|thumb|A party scene from ''[[Second Life]]'' set in [[Hyrule]]]]

[[Virtual world]]s are the most interactive of all virtual community forms. In this type of virtual community, people are connected by living as an [[avatar (computing)|avatar]] in a computer-based world. Users create their own avatar character (from choosing the avatar's outfits to designing the avatar's house) and control their character's life and interactions with other characters in the 3D virtual world. It is similar to a computer game; however, there is no objective for the players. A virtual world simply gives users the opportunity to build and operate a fantasy life in the virtual realm. Characters within the world can talk to one another and have almost the same interactions people would have in reality. For example, characters can socialize with one another and hold intimate relationships online.

This type of virtual community allows for people to not only hold conversations with others in real time, but also to engage and interact with others. The avatars that users create are like humans. Users can choose to make avatars like themselves, or take on an entirely different personality than them. When characters interact with other characters, they can get to know one another through text-based talking and virtual experience (such as having avatars go on a date in the virtual world). A virtual community chat room may give real-time conversations, but people can only talk to one another. In a virtual world, characters can do activities together, just like friends could do in reality. Communities in virtual worlds are most similar to real-life communities because the characters are physically in the same place, even if the users who are operating the characters are not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hevra.haifa.ac.il/~soc/lecturers/talmud/files/547.htm|title=Virtuality and Its Discontents|last=Turkle |first=Sherry|date=11 July 2010|work=The American Prospect|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726150252/http://hevra.haifa.ac.il/~soc/lecturers/talmud/files/547.htm|archive-date=26 July 2010|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Second Life]]'' is one of the most popular virtual worlds on the Internet. [[Whyville]] offers an alternative for younger audiences where safety and privacy are a concern. In Whyville, players use the virtual world's simulation aspect to experiment and learn about various phenomena.

Another use for virtual worlds has been in business communications. Benefits from virtual world technology such as photo realistic avatars and positional sound create an atmosphere for participants that provides a less fatiguing sense of presence. Enterprise controls that allow the meeting host to dictate the permissions of the attendees such as who can speak, or who can move about allow the host to control the meeting environment. [[Zoom (software)|Zoom]], is a popular platform that has grown over the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]. Where those who host meetings on this platform, can dictate who can or cannot speak, by muting or unmuting them, along with who is able to join. Several companies are creating business based virtual worlds including ''Second Life''. These business based worlds have stricter controls and allow functionality such as muting individual participants, desktop sharing, or access lists to provide a highly interactive and controlled virtual world to a specific business or group. Business based virtual worlds also may provide various enterprise features such as Single Sign on with third party providers, or Content Encryption.{{Citation needed|date=February 2023}}

===Social network services===
[[File:Ad-tech London 2010 (5).JPG|thumb|Facebook on the Ad-tech 2010]]

[[Social networking service]]s are the most prominent type of virtual community. They are either a website or software platform that focuses on creating and maintaining relationships. [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], and [[Instagram]] are all virtual communities. With these sites, one often creates a profile or account, and adds friends or follow friends. This allows people to connect and look for support using the social networking service as a gathering place. These websites often allow for people to keep up to date with their friends and acquaintances' activities without making much of an effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Quan-Hasse|first1=A.|last2=Young|first2=A. L.|year=2010|title=Uses and Gratifications of Social Media: A Comparison of Facebook and Instant Messaging|journal=Bulletin of Science, Technology &amp; Society|volume=30|issue=5|pages=350–361|doi=10.1177/0270467610380009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On several of these sites you may be able to video chat, with several people at once, making the connections feel more like you are together. On Facebook, for example, one can upload photos and videos, chat, make friends, reconnect with old ones, and join groups or causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last=Waisanen|first=D.|year=2010|title=Facebook, Diasporic-Virtual Publics, and Networked Argumentation|publisher=Conference Proceedings – National Communication Association/American Forensic Association|conference=Alta Conference on Argumentation|pages=550–557}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Specialized information communities===
Participatory culture plays a large role in online and virtual communities. In participatory culture, users feel that their contributions are important and that by contributing, they are forming meaningful connections with other users. The differences between being a producer of content on the website and being a consumer on the website become blurred and overlap. According to [[Henry Jenkins]], "Members believe their contributions matter and feel some degree of social connection with one another "(Jenkins, et al. 2005). The exchange and consumption of information requires a degree of "[[digital literacy]]", such that users are able to "archive, annotate, appropriate, transform and recirculate media content" (Jenkins). Specialized information communities centralizes a specific group of users who are all interested in the same topic. For example, TasteofHome.com, the website of the magazine ''[[Taste of Home]]'', is a specialized information community that focuses on baking and cooking. The users contribute consumer information relating to their hobby and additionally participate in further specialized groups and forums. Specialized Information Communities are a place where people with similar interests can discuss and share their experiences and interests.

==Howard Rheingold's study==
[[Howard Rheingold]]'s ''Virtual Community'' could be compared with [[Mark Granovetter]]'s ground-breaking "strength of weak ties" article published twenty years earlier in the ''[[American Journal of Sociology]]''. Rheingold translated, practiced and published Granovetter's conjectures about strong and weak ties in the online world. His comment on the first page even illustrates the social networks in the virtual society: "My seven year old daughter knows that her father congregates with a family of invisible friends who seem to gather in his computer. Sometimes he talks to them, even if nobody else can see them. And she knows that these invisible friends sometimes show up in the flesh, materializing from the next block or the other side of the world" (page 1).  Indeed, in his revised version of ''Virtual Community'', Rheingold goes so far to say that had he read [[Barry Wellman]]'s work earlier, he would have called his book "online [[social network]]s".

Rheingold's definition contains the terms "social aggregation and personal relationships" (page 3). Lipnack and Stamps (1997)&lt;ref name="Lipnack-1997"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Virtual teams: reaching across space, time, and organizations with technology|last=Lipnack|first=Jessica|date=1997|publisher=Wiley|editor=Stamps, Jeffrey|isbn=978-0471165538|location=New York|oclc=36138326|url=https://archive.org/details/virtualteamsreac00lipn}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mowshowitz (1997) point out how virtual communities can work across space, time and organizational boundaries; Lipnack and Stamps (1997)&lt;ref name="Lipnack-1997" /&gt; mention a common purpose; and Lee, Eom, Jung and Kim (2004) introduce "desocialization" which means that there is less frequent interaction with humans in traditional settings, e.g. an increase in virtual socialization. Calhoun (1991) presents a [[dystopia]] argument, asserting the impersonality of virtual networks. He argues that IT has a negative influence on offline interaction between individuals because virtual life takes over our lives. He believes that it also creates different personalities in people which can cause frictions in offline and online communities and groups and in personal contacts. (Wellman &amp; Haythornthwaite, 2002). Recently, Mitch Parsell (2008) has suggested that virtual communities, particularly those that leverage Web 2.0 resources, can be pernicious by leading to attitude polarization, increased prejudices and enabling sick individuals to deliberately indulge in their diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Pernicious virtual communities: Identity, polarisation and the Web 2.0|author=Parsell, M.|journal=Ethics and Information Technology|volume=10|issue=1|pages=41–56|doi=10.1007/s10676-008-9153-y|year=2008|s2cid=33207414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages of Internet communities==
Internet communities offer the advantage of instant information exchange that is not possible in a real-life community. This interaction allows people to engage in many activities from their home, such as: shopping, paying bills, and searching for specific information. Users of online communities also have access to thousands of specific discussion groups where they can form specialized relationships and access information in such categories as: politics, technical assistance, social activities, health (see above) and recreational pleasures. Virtual communities provide an ideal medium for these types of relationships because information can easily be posted and response times can be very fast. Another benefit is that these types of communities can give users a feeling of membership and belonging. Users can give and receive support, and it is simple and cheap to use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Blanchard|first1=A.L.|last2=Markus|first2=M.L.|year=2002|title=Sense of virtual community—maintaining the experience of belonging|conference=Proceedings of the 35th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences|citeseerx=10.1.1.11.9800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economically, virtual communities can be commercially successful, making money through membership fees, subscriptions, usage fees, and advertising commission. Consumers generally feel very comfortable making transactions online provided that the seller has a good reputation throughout the community. Virtual communities also provide the advantage of [[disintermediation]] in commercial transactions, which eliminates vendors and connects buyers directly to suppliers. Disintermediation eliminates pricey mark-ups and allows for a more direct line of contact between the consumer and the manufacturer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rothaermel|first1=F.T.|last2=Sugiyama|first2=S.|year=2001|title=Virtual internet communities and commercial success: individual and community-level theory grounded in the atypical case of timezone.com|journal=Journal of Management|volume=27|issue=3|pages=297–312|doi=10.1177/014920630102700305|s2cid=220594818}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disadvantages of Internet communities==
While instant communication means fast access, it also means that information is posted without being reviewed for correctness. It is difficult to choose reliable sources because there is no editor who reviews each post and makes sure it is up to a certain degree of quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=M.A.|last2=Kollock|first2=P.|year=1999|title=Communities in cyberspace|location=New York, New York|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In theory, online identities can be kept anonymous which enables people to use the virtual community for fantasy role playing as in the case of ''Second Life''{{'}}s use of avatars. Some professionals urge caution with users who use online communities because predators also frequent these communities looking for victims who are vulnerable to online [[identity theft]] or [[online predator]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Foster|first=D.|date=18 December 2000|title=Community and identity in the electronic village|url=http://services.exeter.ac.uk/cmit/media/texts/porter1996/foster1996_community_and_identity/|access-date=15 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110117045700/http://services.exeter.ac.uk/cmit/media/texts/porter1996/foster1996_community_and_identity/|archive-date=17 January 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also issues surrounding bullying on internet communities. With users not having to show their face, people may use threatening and discriminating acts towards other people because they feel that they would not face any consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Humphreys|first=Lee|date=August 2011|title=Who's Watching Whom?

There are standing issues with gender and race on the online community as well, where only the majority is represented on the screen, and those of different background and genders are underrepresented.&lt;ref name="Nakamura-2013"/&gt;

[[File:Platypus article on Vector 2022.png|thumb|[[Wikipedia]] is an example of an online encyclopedia the content of which is created by volunteer contributors.]]
An '''online encyclopedia''', also called an '''Internet encyclopedia''', is a digital [[encyclopedia]] accessible through the [[Internet]]. Some examples include pre-web services that offered the ''[[Academic American Encyclopedia]]'' beginning in 1980,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Roncaglia |first=Gino |date=2021 |title=Encyclopedias and encyclopedism in the era of the Web |url=https://jlis.fupress.net/index.php/jlis/article/view/375 |journal=JLIS |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=69–90 |doi=10.4403/jlis.it-12757}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Encyclopedia.com]] since 1998, [[Encarta]] from 2000 to 2009, [[Wikipedia]] since 2001, and ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' since 2016.

== Digitization of old content ==
[[File:Indri EncyclopediaBritannica 11th Ed. p.501.gif|thumb|A scan of [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|the 11th edition of ''Encyclopedia Britannica'']] at archive.org]]
In January 1995, [[Project Gutenberg]] started to publish the [[ASCII]] text of the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 11th edition]] (1911), but disagreements about the method halted the work after the first volume. For [[trademark]] reasons, the text had been published as the Gutenberg Encyclopedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=January 1, 1995 |title=The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Project Gutenberg Encyclopedia |url=https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/200/pg200.txt |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231219154643/https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/200/pg200.txt |archive-date=December 19, 2023 |access-date=December 19, 2023 |website=Project Gutenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, Project Gutenberg [[Digitization|digitized]] and proofread the encyclopedia, until the last update in September 2018.  Project Gutenberg published volumes in alphabetical order; the most recent publication is ''Volume 17 Slice 1: "[[Lord Chamberlain]]" to "[[Luqman]]"'', published on August 9, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author= |title=Encyclopaedia Britannica, 11th Edition, "Lord Chamberlain" to "Luqman" |date=9 August 2013 |url=https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/43427 |access-date=19 December 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231219154856/https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/43427 |url-status=live |archive-date=19 December 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The latest ''Britannica'' was digitized by its publishers, and sold first as a [[CD-ROM]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Britannica Encyclopædia |url=https://store.britannica.com/collections/software |title=Software |website=The Britannica Store |access-date=15 January 2019 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190115184502/https://store.britannica.com/collections/software|archive-date=  15 January 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and later as an online service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Britannica Encyclopædia |url=https://www.britannica.com/ |title=Encyclopedia Britannica {{!}} Britannica |website=britannica.com |access-date=15 January 2019 |archive-date=25 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180125191151/https://www.britannica.com/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, ASCII text of all 28 volumes was published on ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Eleventh Edition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://1911encyclopedia.org/ |title=The 1911 edition of Encyclopedia Britannica |website=1911encyclopedia.org |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010927163517/http://1911encyclopedia.org/ |archive-date=27 September 2001 |access-date=8 August 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by source; a [[Copyright|copyright claim]] was added to the materials included. The [[website]] no longer exists.

Other digitization projects have made progress in other titles; one example is ''[[Easton's Bible Dictionary (1897)]]'' digitized by the [[Christian Classics Ethereal Library]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccel.org/e/easton/ebd/ |title=Easton's Bible Dictionary by Easton |website=Christian Classics Ethereal Library |access-date=18 June 2003 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030803070823/http://www.ccel.org/e/easton/ebd/ |archive-date=3 August 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other websites provide online encyclopedias, some of which are also available on [[Wikisource]]. However, some may be more complete than those on Wikisource, or may be from different editions.

==Creation of new content==


Another early online encyclopedia was called the ''Global Encyclopedia''.  In November 1995, James Rettig, Assistant Dean of University Libraries for Reference and Information Services at [[College of William &amp; Mary]], presented an unfavorable review at the 15th Annual [[Charleston Conference]] on library acquisitions and related issues.  He said of the ''Global Encyclopedia'':&lt;ref name="swem.wm.edu 2005"&gt;{{cite web | title=Putting the Squeeze on the Information Firehose: The Need for 'Neteditors and 'Netreviewers | website=swem.wm.edu | date=11 January 2005 |url=http://www.swem.wm.edu/firehose.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050111085445/http://www.swem.wm.edu/firehose.html | archive-date=11 January 2005 | url-status=dead | access-date=15 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{blockquote|
This is a volunteer effort to compile an encyclopedia and distribute it for free on the World Wide Web. If you have ever yearned to be the author of an encyclopedia article, yearn no longer. Take a minute (or even two or three if you are feeling scholarly) to write an article on a topic of your choosing and [e]mail it off to the unnamed "editors". These editors (to use that title very loosely) have generated a list of approximately 1,300 topics they want to include; to date, perhaps a quarter of them have been treated. ... This so-called encyclopedia gives amateurism a bad name. It is being compiled without standards or guidelines for article structure, content, or reading level. It makes no apparent effort to check the qualifications and authority of the volunteer authors. Its claim that "Submitted articles are fact-checked, corrected for spelling, and then formatted" is at best an exaggeration.&lt;ref name="swem.wm.edu 2005"/&gt;

Examples of article entries included [[Iowa City, Iowa|Iowa City]]:

It is also the home of the University of Iowa (http://www.uiowa.edu).&lt;ref name="swem.wm.edu 2005"/&gt;}}[[Wikipedia]] is a [[free content]], multilingual online encyclopedia written and maintained by a community of volunteer contributors, known as [[Wikipedia community|Wikipedians]], through a model of [[open collaboration]].

{{sisterlinks|World Wide Web}}
The '''World Wide Web''' (abbreviated as '''WWW''' or '''W3''', commonly known as '''the web'''), is a [[information system|system]] of interlinked [[hypertext]] documents accessed via the [[Internet]]. With a [[web browser]], one can view [[web page]]s that may contain text, images, videos, and other [[multimedia]], and [[web navigation|navigate]] between them via [[hyperlink]]s. &lt;!-- this is the 1st paragraph of [[World Wide Web]] --&gt;

The terms Internet and [[World Wide Web]] are often used in every-day speech without much distinction (as can be seen in the several subcategories below, titled "Internet ..." that should be "World Wide Web ..."). However, the Internet and the World Wide Web are not one and the same. The Internet is a global data communications system. It is a hardware and software infrastructure that provides connectivity between computers. Simply, "Internet is a network of networks", where two or more than two computers connected through the wired or wireless network for sending and receiving the date like- mails, video, song etc. In contrast, the Web is one of the services communicated via the Internet. The Web is a collection of interconnected documents and other resources, linked by [[hyperlinks]] and [[URL]]s. Other services using the internet include [[electronic mail]], [[File Transfer Protocol]], [[Telnet]], [[online chat]], [[Voice over Internet Protocol]], [[Instant messaging]], [[Fax]], and [[Usenet]]. &lt;!-- this same text, less parenthetical comment, is in [[:Category:Internet]] --&gt; 
&lt;!-- other services are listed so that people cataloging articles will be less likely to include those articles here --&gt;

{{Cat main|Internet governance}}
The Internet is not controlled by a single person or body in the way that a corporation or a state might be. Instead, different functions are carried out by different bodies, in a way which is still evolving. This category pulls together articles on the organization of the Internet and on the bodies and groups which have a role in its development and operation. 

The use of the word "governance" here probably implies more power than actually exists in these bodies, as they essentially represent just a collection of standards for sharing traffic between networks.

{{Cat main|Internet hosting services}}
This category is for articles relating to [[Internet Service Providers]] hosting services. An ISP connects to its customers using a data transmission technology appropriate for delivering Internet Protocol datagrams, such as dial-up, DSL, cable modem or dedicated high-speed interconnects.

ISPs may provide Internet e-mail accounts to users which allow them to communicate with one another by sending and receiving electronic messages through their ISPs' servers. ISPs may provide other services such as remotely storing data files on behalf of their customers, as well as other services unique to each particular ISP.

For other application hosting, see [[:Category:Web hosting]].

'''Communication software''' is used to provide remote access to systems and exchange files and messages in text, audio and/or video formats between different computers or [[User (computing)|user]]s. This includes [[terminal emulator]]s, [[file transfer]] programs, chat and [[instant messaging]] programs, as well as similar functionality integrated within [[Multi-user dungeon|MUD]]s. The term is also applied to software operating a [[bulletin board system]], but seldom to that operating a [[computer network]] or [[Stored Program Control exchange]].

==History==
[[E-mail]]  was introduced in the early 1960's as a way for multiple users of a [[time-sharing]] [[mainframe computer]] to communicate. Basic [[text chat]] functionality has existed on [[multi-user]] computer systems and [[bulletin board system]]s since the early 1970s. In the 1980s, a [[terminal emulator]] was a piece of software necessary to log into [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]]s and thus access [[e-mail]].  Prior to the rise of the Internet, computer files were exchanged over [[dialup]] lines, requiring ways to send [[binary file]]s over communication systems that were primarily intended for [[plain text]]; programs implementing special transfer modes were implemented using various [[de facto standard]]s, most notably [[Kermit (protocol)|Kermit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.multicians.org/thvv/mail-history.html |title=The History of Electronic Mail |author=Van Vleck, Tom |date=February 1, 2001 |work=Describes the history of electronic mail and instant messaging |accessdate=November 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chat ==
{{Further|Online chat}}
In 1985 the first decentralized chat system was created called [[Bitnet Relay]], whereas [[Minitel]] probably provided the largest chat system at the same time. In August 1988 the [[Internet Relay Chat]] followed. [[CU-SeeMe]] was the first chat system to be equipped with a [[webcam|video camera]]. [[Instant messaging]] featuring a ''buddy list'' and the notion of online [[Presence information|presence]] was introduced by [[ICQ]] in 1996. In the days of the [[History of the Internet|Internet boom]], [[web chat]]s were very popular, too.

Chatting is a [[Real-time computing|real-time]] conversation or message exchange that takes place in public or in private groupings called [[chat room]]s. Some chatrooms have moderators who will trace and block offensive comments and other kinds of abuse. Based on visual representation chats are divided into text based chat room just as were [[IRC]] and [[Bitnet Relay Chat]], 2D – supporting graphic smilies; and 3D the conversation in which takes place in 2D graphic surrounding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://epubl.luth.se/1402-1552/1998/02/HTML/3.html |title=Internet Relay Chat (IRC) Discourse |author=Jonsson, Ewa |date=March 4, 1998 |work=A document discussing internet "chat" and the history of IRC |accessdate=November 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to the Internet.

The '''[[Internet]]''' is a worldwide, publicly accessible network of interconnected [[computer network]]s that transmit [[Data (computing)|data]] by [[packet switching]] using the standard [[Internet Protocol]] (IP). It is a "network of networks" that consists of millions of interconnected smaller domestic, academic, business, and government networks, which together carry various [[information]] and services, such as [[electronic mail]], [[online chat]], [[Computer file|file]] transfer, and the interlinked [[Web page]]s and other documents of the [[World Wide Web]].

{{More citations needed|date=August 2007}}
'''A sideblog''' is a feature on a website, particularly a [[blog]], that allows one to communicate smaller snippets of information than an actual blog post. The reasoning is that a blog post will require thought, argument and some semantic structuring of the post, while a sideblog typically displays "brief asides". A sideblog is meant to illustrate your immediate thoughts, movements or status update, and is usually less than 200 [[Character (computing)|characters]]. Where a blog post may be compared to a newspaper opinion piece, a sideblog would be akin to the "news in brief" column.

Sideblogging is wedded to the concept of [[micro-blogging]], where one posts brief snippets to interested observers via [[text messaging]], [[instant messaging]], [[email]] or [[World Wide Web|the web]]. Using the same tools, one can post to one's micro-blog and to one's sideblog simultaneously. Most sideblogs are actually embedded micro-blogs that appear in a small sidebar box next to the main blog posts and use [[Web feed|feeds]] or [[plug-in (computing)|plugins]] to display the content.

Frequently updating one's status and frame of mind in an online platform to be viewed by friends gained widespread adoption through [[social networking]] tools like [[Facebook]] and [[MySpace]]. While those tools are still largely desktop-bound, micro-blogs (and, by extension, sideblogs) are designed to be updated from mobile devices as well as desktop computers. Therefore, it is more convenient to post one's status with a simple text message, and interested parties can note your status by browsing your sideblog or receiving a text or [[instant messaging]] alert.

This meaning came to change with the advent of [[blogroll]]s, blog engine [[plug-in (computing)|plugins]], and widgets and third-party lists of [[social media]], like tag clouds and [[social bookmarking|social bookmarks]].

{{Sociology}}
{{Internet}}
The '''sociology of the Internet''' (or the '''social psychology of the internet''') involves the application of sociological or social psychological theory and method to the [[Internet]] as a source of information and communication. The overlapping field of '''digital sociology''' focuses on understanding the use of [[digital media]] as part of everyday life, and how these various technologies contribute to patterns of human behavior, social relationships, and [[Self-concept|concepts of the self]]. [[Sociologists]] are concerned with the social implications of the technology; new [[social networks]], [[Virtual community|virtual communities]] and ways of [[Social interaction|interaction]] that have arisen, as well as issues related to [[cyber crime]].

The Internet—[[History of communication|the newest]] in a series of major [[Information revolution|information breakthroughs]]—is of interest for sociologists in various ways: as a tool for [[social research|research]], for example, in using [[online]] [[questionnaires]] instead of paper ones, as a discussion platform, and as a research topic. The [[sociology]] of the Internet in the stricter sense concerns the analysis of [[online communities]] (e.g. as found in [[newsgroups]]), [[virtual communities]] and [[Virtual World|virtual worlds]], organizational change catalyzed through [[new media]] such as the Internet, and social change at-large in the transformation from [[Industrial society|industrial]] to [[informational society]] (or to [[information society]]). Online communities can be studied statistically through [[Social network#Social network analysis|network analysis]] and at the same time interpreted qualitatively, such as through [[virtual ethnography]]. Social change can be studied through statistical [[demographics]] or through the interpretation of changing messages and symbols in online [[media studies]].

==Emergence of the discipline==
The Internet is a relatively new phenomenon. As [[Robert Darnton]] wrote, it is a revolutionary change that "took place yesterday, or the day before, depending on how you measure it."&lt;ref name="Darnton"&gt;Robert Darnton, ''[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/21514 The Library in the New Age] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526013310/http://www.nybooks.com/articles/21514 |date=2008-05-26 }}'', The New York Review of Books, Volume 55, Number 10. June 12, 2008. Retrieved on 22 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The Internet developed from the [[ARPANET]], dating back to 1969; as a term it was coined in 1974. The [[World Wide Web]] as we know it was shaped in the mid-1990s, when [[graphical interface]] and services like [[email]] became popular and reached wider (non-scientific and non-military) audiences and [[commerce]].&lt;ref name="Darnton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DiMaggio"&gt;Paul DiMaggio, Eszter Hargittai, W. Russell Neuman, and John P. Robinson, ''Social Implications of the Internet'', Annual Review of Sociology, Vol. 27: 307-336 (Volume publication date August 2001), {{doi|10.1146/annurev.soc.27.1.307}} [http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.soc.27.1.307] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200511235037/https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.soc.27.1.307|date=2020-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Internet Explorer]] was first released in 1995; [[Netscape]] a year earlier. [[Google]] was founded in 1998.&lt;ref name="Darnton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DiMaggio"/&gt; [[Wikipedia]] was founded in 2001. [[Facebook]], [[MySpace]], and [[YouTube]] in the mid-2000s. [[Web 2.0]] is still emerging. The amount of information available on the net and the [[Global Internet usage|number of Internet users worldwide]] has continued to grow rapidly.&lt;ref name="DiMaggio"/&gt; The term '[[digital sociology]]' is now becoming increasingly used to denote new directions in sociological research into digital technologies since Web 2.0.

===Digital sociology===
The first scholarly article to have the term ''digital sociology'' in the title appeared in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Wynn, J. (2009) Digital sociology: emergent technologies in the field and the classroom. ''Sociological Forum'', 24(2), 448--456&lt;/ref&gt; The author reflects on the ways in which digital technologies may influence both sociological research and teaching. In 2010, 'digital sociology' was described, by [[Richard Neal (sociologist)|Richard Neal]], in terms of bridging the growing academic focus with the increasing interest from global business.&lt;ref&gt;Neal, R. (2010) ''Expanding Sentience: Introducing Digital Sociology for moving beyond Buzz Metrics in a World of Growing Online Socialization.'' Lulu&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until 2013 that the first purely academic book tackling the subject of 'digital sociology' was published.&lt;ref&gt;Orton-Johnson, K. and Prior, N. (eds) (2013) ''Digital Sociology: Critical Perspectives''. Houndmills: Palgrave Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt; The first sole-authored book entitled ''Digital Sociology'' was published in 2015,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Lupton, D. (2015) ''Digital Sociology''. London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; and the first academic conference on "Digital Sociology" was held in New York, NY in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author1=Daniels, J. | author2=Gregory, K. | author3=Cottom, T.M. | via=Digital Sociology MiniConference, organized in conjunction with the Eastern Sociological Society meetings | date=2015-02-27 | title=The First Digital Sociology Conference 2015 | url=http://digsoc.commons.gc.cuny.edu/conference-papers-2015/ | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211026135734/https://digsoc.commons.gc.cuny.edu/conference-papers-2015/ | archive-date=2021-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the term ''digital sociology'' has not yet fully entered the cultural lexicon, sociologists have engaged in research related to the Internet since its inception. These sociologists have addressed many social issues relating to [[online communities]], [[cyberspace]] and cyber-identities. This and similar research has attracted many different names such as ''cyber-sociology'', the ''sociology of the internet'', the ''sociology of online communities'', the ''sociology of social media'', the ''sociology of cyberculture'', or something else again.

Digital sociology differs from these terms in that it is wider in its scope, addressing not only the Internet or [[cyberculture]] but also the impact of the other digital media and devices that have emerged since the first decade of the twenty-first century. Since the Internet has become more pervasive and linked with everyday life, references to the 'cyber' in the social sciences seems now to have been replaced by the 'digital'. 'Digital sociology' is related to other sub-disciplines such as [[digital humanities]] and [[digital anthropology]]. It is beginning to supersede and incorporate the other titles above, as well as including the newest [[Web 2.0]] digital technologies into its purview, such as [[wearable technology]], [[augmented reality]], [[smart objects]], the [[Internet of Things]] and [[big data]].

==Research trends==
According to DiMaggio et al. (1999),&lt;ref name="DiMaggio"/&gt; research tends to focus on the Internet's implications in five domains:
# [[Economic inequality|inequality]] (the issues of [[digital divide]])
# [[public]] and [[social capital]] (the issues of [[date displacement]])
# [[political participation]] (the issues of [[public sphere]], [[deliberative democracy]] and [[civil society]])
# [[organization]]s and other economic institutions
# [[participatory culture]] and [[cultural diversity]]

Early on, there were predictions that the Internet would change everything (or nothing); over time, however, a consensus emerged that the Internet, at least in the current phase of development, complements rather than displaces previously implemented [[Media (communication)|media]].&lt;ref name="DiMaggio"/&gt; This has meant a rethinking of the 1990s ideas of "convergence of new and old media". Further, the Internet offers a rare opportunity to study changes caused by the newly emerged—and likely, still evolving—[[information and communication technology]] (ICT).&lt;ref name="DiMaggio"/&gt;

==Social impact==
The Internet has created [[social network service]]s, forums of [[social interaction]] and [[social relations]], such as [[Facebook]], [[MySpace]], [[Meetup]], and [[CouchSurfing]] which facilitate both online and offline interaction.

Though [[virtual communities]] were once thought to be composed of strictly virtual social ties, researchers often find that even those social ties formed in virtual spaces are often maintained both online and offline&lt;ref&gt;Lauren F. Sessions, "How offline gatherings affect online community members: when virtual community members ‘meetup’.""Information, Communication, and Society"13,3(April, 2010):375-395&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bo Xie, B. ‘The mutual shaping of online and offline social relationships."Information Research, 1,3(2008):n.p.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are ongoing debates about the impact of the Internet on [[strong ties|strong]] and [[weak ties]], whether the Internet is creating more or less [[social capital]],&lt;ref&gt;Lee Rainie, John Horrigan, Barry Wellman, and Jeffrey Boase.

It is often said the Internet is a new frontier, and there is a line of argument to the effect that social interaction, cooperation and conflict among users resembles the anarchistic and violent [[American frontier]] of the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Jensen. "Military History on the Electronic Frontier: Wikipedia Fights the War of 1812," ''The Journal of Military History'' (October 2012) 76#4  pp 1165-82 [http://www.americanhistoryprojects.com/downloads/JMH1812.PDF online] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171203075654/http://www.americanhistoryprojects.com/downloads/JMH1812.PDF |date=2017-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, researchers from the [[Benedictine University at Mesa]] in [[Arizona]] studied how online interactions affect face-to-face meetings. The study is titled, "Face to Face Versus Facebook: Does Exposure to Social Networking Web Sites Augment or Attenuate Physiological Arousal Among the Socially Anxious," published in ''[[Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking]]''.&lt;ref name=Charles-Study&gt;{{cite news|last=Charles|first=Megan|title=Meeting Facebook Friends Face To Face Causes Anxiety (Study)|url=http://www.business2community.com/social-buzz/meeting-facebook-friends-face-face-causes-anxiety-study-0803603#!yTDAe|access-date=7 March 2014|newspaper=Business 2 Community|date=7 March 2014|archive-date=7 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307222718/http://www.business2community.com/social-buzz/meeting-facebook-friends-face-face-causes-anxiety-study-0803603#!yTDAe|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; They analyzed 26 female students with electrodes to measure social anxiety. Prior to meeting people, the students were shown pictures of the subject they were expected to meet. Researchers found that meeting someone face-to-face after looking at their photos increases arousal, which the study linked to an increase in social anxiety. These findings confirm previous studies that found that socially anxious people prefer online interactions. The study also recognized that the stimulated arousal can be associated with positive emotions and could lead to positive feelings.

Recent research has taken the [[Internet of Things]] within its purview, as global networks of interconnected everyday objects are said to be the next step in technological advancement.&lt;ref name="AtzoriIera2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Atzori|first1=Luigi|last2=Iera|first2=Antonio|last3=Morabito|first3=Giacomo|last4=Nitti|first4=Michele|title=The Social Internet of Things (SIoT) – When social networks meet the Internet of Things: Concept, architecture and network characterization|journal=Computer Networks|volume=56|issue=16|year=2012|pages=3594–3608|issn=1389-1286|doi=10.1016/j.comnet.2012.07.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certainly, global space- and earth-based networks are expanding coverage of the IoT at a fast pace.

== Digital Sociology and Data Emotions ==
Digital sociology is connected with data and data emotions&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fussey and Roth|first=Pete and Silke|date=June 1, 2020|title=Digitizing Sociology: Continuity and Change in the Internet Era|journal=Department of Sociology|volume=54 |issue=4 |pages=659–674 |doi=10.1177/0038038520918562 |s2cid=220533863 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data emotions happens when people use digital technologies that can effect their decision-making skills or emotions. Social media platforms collects users data while also effecting their emotional state of mind, which causes either solidarity or social engagement amongst users. Social media platforms such as Instagram and Twitter can evoke emotions of love, affection, and empathy. Viral challenges such as the 2014 Ice Bucket Challenge&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; and viral memes has brought people together through mass participation displaying cultural knowledge and understanding of self. Mass participation in viral events prompts users to spread information (data) to one another effecting psychological state of mind and emotions. The link between digital sociology and data emotions is formed through the integration of technological devices within everyday life and activities.

=== The impact on children ===
[[File:Meebox_electronics.PNG|thumb|Technological devices can be used intensively.]]Researchers have investigated the use of [[technology]] (as opposed to the Internet) by children and how it can be used excessively, where it can cause medical health and psychological issues.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal |pmc = 4338000 |year = 2014 |last1 = Rosen |first1 = L.

Children can use technology to enhance their learning skills - for example: using online programs to improve the way they learn how to read or do math. The resources technology provides for children may enhance their skills, but children should be cautious of what they get themselves into due to how cyber bullying may occur. [[Cyber bullying]] can cause academic and psychological effects due to how children are suppressed by people who bully them through the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title= Unknown|citeseerx = 10.1.1.688.1918}}{{Dead link | date=December 2024 | fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; When technology is introduced to children they are not forced to accept it, but instead children are permitted to have an input on what they feel about either deciding to use their technological device or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first= Allison|last= Druin|author-link= Allison Druin|date= 1999-10-02|title= The Role of Children in the Design Technology|url= https://drum.lib.umd.edu/handle/1903/1028|language= en-US|access-date= 2018-04-25|archive-date= 2018-04-25|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180425183537/https://drum.lib.umd.edu/handle/1903/1028|url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{request quotation|date=September 2018}} . The routines of children have changed due to the increasing popularity of internet connected devices, with Social Policy researcher Janet Heaton concluding that, "while the children's health and quality of life benefited from the technology, the time demands of the care routines and lack of compatibility with other social and institutional timeframes had some negative implications".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.york.ac.uk/res/iht/projects/l218252023/Heatonhsc_571.pdf | title=Families' experiences of caring for technology-dependent children: a temporal perspective | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170814164115/https://www.york.ac.uk/res/iht/projects/l218252023/Heatonhsc_571.pdf |archive-date=2017-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Children's frequent use of technology commonly leads to decreased time available to pursue meaningful friendships, hobbies and potential career options.

While technology can have negative impacts on the lives of children, it can also be used as a valuable [[learning]] tool that can encourage cognitive, linguistic and social development. In a 2010 study by the University of New Hampshire, children that used technological devices exhibited greater improvements in problem-solving, intelligence, language skills and structural knowledge in comparison to those children who did not incorporate the use of technology in their learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ898529.pdf | title=A Tablet Computer for Young Children?

===Political organization and censorship===
{{See also|Internet censorship}}

The Internet has achieved new relevance as a political tool. The presidential campaign of [[Howard Dean]] in 2004 in the [[United States]] became famous for its ability to generate donations via the Internet, and the 2008 campaign of [[Barack Obama]] became even more so. Increasingly, [[social movements]] and other organizations use the Internet to carry out both traditional and the new [[Internet activism]].

Some governments are also getting online. Some countries, such as those of [[Cuba]], [[Iran]], [[North Korea]], [[Myanmar]], the [[People's Republic of China]], and [[Saudi Arabia]] use filtering and censoring software to [[Internet censorship|restrict what people in their countries can access on the Internet]]. In the [[United Kingdom]], they also use software to locate and arrest various individuals they perceive as a threat. Other countries including the United States, have enacted laws making the possession or distribution of certain material such as [[child pornography]] illegal but do not use filtering software. In some countries [[Internet service providers]] have agreed to restrict access to sites listed by police.

===Economics===
While much has been written of the economic advantages of [[Electronic commerce|Internet-enabled commerce]], there is also evidence that some aspects of the Internet such as maps and location-aware services may serve to reinforce [[economic inequality]] and the [[digital divide]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theatlanticcities.com/technology/2013/02/how-internet-reinforces-inequality-real-world/4602/ "How the Internet Reinforces Inequality in the Real World"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211095334/http://www.theatlanticcities.com/technology/2013/02/how-internet-reinforces-inequality-real-world/4602/ |date=2013-02-11 }} ''The Atlantic'' February 6, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Electronic commerce may be responsible for [[Consolidation (business)|consolidation]] and the decline of [[mom-and-pop]], [[brick and mortar]] businesses resulting in increases in [[income inequality]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.zdnet.com/article/e-commerce-will-make-the-shopping-mall-a-retail-wasteland/ "E-commerce will make the shopping mall a retail wasteland"]  ''ZDNet'', January 17, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philanthropy===
The spread of low-cost Internet access in developing countries has opened up new possibilities for [[peer-to-peer charities]], which allow individuals to contribute small amounts to charitable projects for other individuals. Websites such as [[Donors Choose]] and [[Global Giving]] now allow small-scale donors to direct funds to individual projects of their choice.

A popular twist on Internet-based philanthropy is the use of [[peer-to-peer lending]] for charitable purposes. [[Kiva (organization)|Kiva]] pioneered this concept in 2005, offering the first web-based service to publish individual loan profiles for funding. Kiva raises funds for local intermediary [[microfinance]] organizations which post stories and updates on behalf of the borrowers. Lenders can contribute as little as $25 to loans of their choice, and receive their money back as borrowers repay. Kiva falls short of being a pure peer-to-peer charity, in that loans are disbursed prior being funded by lenders and borrowers do not communicate with lenders themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.cgdev.org/open_book/2009/10/kiva-is-not-quite-what-it-seems.php ''Kiva Is Not Quite What It Seems''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210045011/http://blogs.cgdev.org/open_book/2009/10/kiva-is-not-quite-what-it-seems.php |date=2010-02-10 }}, by David Roodman, Center for Global Development, Oct. 2, 2009, as accessed Jan. 2 &amp; 16, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/09/business/global/09kiva.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=Kiva&amp;st=cse ''Confusion on Where Money Lent via Kiva Goes''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180121210513/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/09/business/global/09kiva.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=Kiva&amp;st=cse |date=2018-01-21 }}, by Stephanie Strom, in The New York Times, Nov. 8, 2009, as accessed Jan. 2 &amp; 16, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; However, the recent spread of cheap Internet access in developing countries has made genuine peer-to-peer connections increasingly feasible. In 2009 the US-based nonprofit [[Zidisha]] tapped into this trend to offer the first peer-to-peer microlending platform to link lenders and borrowers across international borders without local intermediaries. Inspired by interactive websites such as [[Facebook]] and [[eBay]], Zidisha's microlending platform facilitates direct dialogue between lenders and borrowers and a performance rating system for borrowers. Web users worldwide can fund loans for as little as a dollar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microfinancefocus.com/news/2010/02/07/zidisha-set-to-expand-in-peer-to-peer-microfinance-julia-kurnia/ "Zidisha Set to "Expand" in Peer-to-Peer Microfinance", Microfinance Focus, Feb 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008230104/http://www.microfinancefocus.com/news/2010/02/07/zidisha-set-to-expand-in-peer-to-peer-microfinance-julia-kurnia/ |date=2011-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leisure===
{{See also|sociology of leisure}}
The Internet has been a major source of [[leisure]] since before the World Wide Web, with entertaining social experiments such as [[Multi-user dungeon|MUD]]s and [[MOO]]s being conducted on university servers, and humor-related [[Usenet]] groups receiving much of the main traffic. Today, many [[Internet forum]]s have sections devoted to games and funny videos; short cartoons in the form of [[Flash animation|Flash movies]] are also popular. Over 6 million people use blogs or message boards as a means of communication and for the sharing of ideas.

The [[pornography]] and [[gambling]] industries have both taken full advantage of the World Wide Web, and often provide a significant source of advertising revenue for other websites. Although governments have made attempts to censor Internet porn, Internet service providers have told governments that these plans are not feasible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chivers|first=Tom|title=Internet pornography block plans: other attempts to control the internet|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/internet/8215030/Internet-pornography-block-plans-other-attempts-to-control-the-internet.html|access-date=24 February 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=Dec 21, 2010|archive-date=22 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180322142941/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/internet/8215030/Internet-pornography-block-plans-other-attempts-to-control-the-internet.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also many governments have attempted to put restrictions on both industries' use of the Internet, this has generally failed to stop their widespread popularity.

One area of leisure on the Internet is [[MMORPG|online gaming]]. This form of leisure creates communities, bringing people of all ages and origins to enjoy the fast-paced world of multiplayer games. These range from [[MMORPG]] to [[first-person shooter]]s, from [[role-playing video game]]s to [[online gambling]]. This has revolutionized the way many people interact and spend their free time on the Internet.

While online gaming has been around since the 1970s, modern modes of online gaming began with services such as [[GameSpy Arcade|GameSpy]] and [[MPlayer.com|MPlayer]], to which players of games would typically subscribe. Non-subscribers were limited to certain types of gameplay or certain games.

Many use the Internet to access and download music, movies and other works for their enjoyment and relaxation. As discussed above, there are paid and unpaid sources for all of these, using centralized servers and distributed peer-to-peer technologies. Discretion is needed as some of these sources take more care over the original artists' rights and over copyright laws than others.

Many use the World Wide Web to access news, weather and sports reports, to plan and book holidays and to find out more about their random ideas and casual interests.

People use [[Internet Relay Chat|chat]], [[Instant messaging|messaging]] and e-mail to make and stay in touch with friends worldwide, sometimes in the same way as some previously had [[pen pal]]s. [[Social networking]] websites like [[MySpace]], [[Facebook]] and many others like them also put and keep people in contact for their enjoyment.

The Internet has seen a growing number of [[Web desktop]]s, where users can access their files, folders, and settings via the Internet.

[[Cyberslacking]] has become a serious drain on corporate resources; the average UK employee spends 57 minutes a day surfing the Web at work, according to a study by [[Peninsula Business Services]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=914&amp;id=1001802003 |title=Scotsman.com News - Net abuse hits small city firms |access-date=2008-07-08 |archive-date=2006-10-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020030002/http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=914&amp;id=1001802003 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''Professional digital practice''': using digital media tools for professional purposes: to build networks, construct an e-profile, publicise and share research and instruct students.
# '''Sociological analyses of digital use''': researching the ways in which people's use of digital media configures their sense of selves, their embodiment and their social relations.
# '''Digital data analysis''': using digital data for social research, either quantitative or qualitative.
# '''Critical digital sociology''': undertaking reflexive and critical analysis of digital media informed by social and cultural theory.

=== Professional digital practice ===
Although they have been reluctant to use social and other digital media for professional academics purposes, sociologists are slowly beginning to adopt them for teaching and research.&lt;ref&gt;Carrigan, M. (2013) [http://markcarrigan.net/2013/06/06/is-the-use-of-sociological-media-becoming-mainstream-within-uk-sociology/ "The emergence of sociological media?

Mark Carrigan.net&lt;/ref&gt; An increasing number of sociological blogs are beginning to appear and more sociologists are joining Twitter, for example. Some are writing about the best ways for sociologists to employ social media as part of academic practice and the importance of [[self-archiving]] and making sociological research open access, as well as writing for [[Wikipedia]].

=== Sociological analyses of digital media use ===
Digital sociologists have begun to write about the use of wearable technologies as part of quantifying the body&lt;ref&gt;Lupton, D. (2013) [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09581596.2013.794931#.UbrhSpN--V4 "Quantifying the body: monitoring and measuring health in the age of mHealth technologies"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200421084734/https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09581596.2013.794931#.UbrhSpN--V4 |date=2020-04-21 }}.

''Critical Social Policy'', 23(2),227-48.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[mass surveillance]] of the Internet that is being conducted by secret services such as the [[National Security Agency|NSA]].&lt;!-- [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)]] --&gt;

The '[[digital divide]]', or the differences in access to digital technologies experienced by certain social groups such as the socioeconomically disadvantaged, those of lower education levels, women and the elderly, has preoccupied many researchers in the social scientific study of digital media. However several sociologists have pointed out that while it is important to acknowledge and identify the [[Structural inequality|structural inequalities]] inherent in differentials in digital technology use, this concept is rather simplistic and fails to incorporate the complexities of access to and knowledge about digital technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Willis, S. and Tranter, B. (2006) [http://www.uk.sagepub.com/chaston/Chaston%20Web%20readings%20chapters%201-12/Chapter%205%20-%2026%20Willis%20&amp;%20Tranter.pdf "Beyond the 'digital divide': Internet diffusion and inequality in Australia"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518090941/http://www.uk.sagepub.com/chaston/Chaston%20Web%20readings%20chapters%201-12/Chapter%205%20-%2026%20Willis%20%26%20Tranter.pdf |date=2015-05-18 }}. Journal of Sociology, 42(1), 43-59&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a growing interest in the ways in which social media contributes to the development of intimate relationships and concepts of the self. One of the best-known sociologists who has written about social relationships, selfhood and digital technologies is [[Sherry Turkle]].&lt;ref&gt;Turkle, S. (1984) [http://monoskop.org/images/5/55/Turkle_Sherry_The_Second_Self_Computers_and_the_Human_Spirit_20th_ed.pdf "The Second Self: Computers and the Human Spirit"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210925094313/https://monoskop.org/images/5/55/Turkle_Sherry_The_Second_Self_Computers_and_the_Human_Spirit_20th_ed.pdf |date=2021-09-25 }}. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Turkle, S. (1995) [[Life on the Screen|"Life on the Screen: Identity in the Age of the Internet"]]. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt; In her most recent book, Turkle addresses the topic of social media.&lt;ref&gt;Turkle, S. (2011) ''Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other''. New York: Basic Books&lt;/ref&gt; She argues that relationships conducted via these platforms are not as authentic as those encounters that take place "in real life".

Visual media allows the viewer to be a more passive consumer of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Wynn|first=Jonathan R|title=Digital Sociology: Emergent Technologies in the Field and the Classroom|url=https://www.academia.edu/26473501|language=en|access-date=2021-10-23|archive-date=2023-01-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230117170923/https://www.academia.edu/26473501|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viewers are more likely to develop online personas that differ from their personas in the real world. This contrast between the digital world (or 'cyberspace') and the 'real world', however, has been critiqued as ''''digital dualism'''', a concept similar to the '[[The Aura of the Digital|aura of the digital]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Betancourt, M. (2006) [http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=519 "The Aura of the Digital"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200526150054/http://ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=519 |date=2020-05-26 }}, CTheory&lt;/ref&gt; Other sociologists have argued that relationships conducted through digital media are inextricably part of the 'real world'.&lt;ref&gt;Jurgenson, N. (2012) [http://www.mdpi.com/1999-5903/4/1/83 "When atoms meet bits: social media, the mobile web and augmented revolution"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230117170924/https://www.mdpi.com/1999-5903/4/1/83 |date=2023-01-17 }}. ''Future Internet'', 4, 83-91&lt;/ref&gt; [[Augmented reality]] is an interactive experience where reality is being altered in some way by the use of digital media but not replaced.

The use of social media for [[social activism]] have also provided a focus for digital sociology. For example, numerous sociological articles,&lt;ref&gt;Maireder, A. and Schwartzenegger, C. (2011) A movement of connected individuals: social media in the Austrian student protests 2009. ''Information, Communication &amp; Society'', 15(2), 1-25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lim, M. (2012) [http://cspo.org/legacy/library/1207150932F24192826YK_lib_LimJoC2012Egypt.pdf "Clicks, cabs, and coffee houses: social media and oppositional movements in Egypt"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501062405/http://cspo.org/legacy/library/1207150932F24192826YK_lib_LimJoC2012Egypt.pdf |date=2015-05-01 }}, 2004-2011. ''Journal of Communication'', 62(2), 231-248.&lt;/ref&gt; and at least one book&lt;ref&gt;Murthy, D. (2013) ''Twitter: Social Communication in the Twitter Age''. Cambridge: Polity Press.&lt;/ref&gt; have appeared on the use of such social media platforms as Twitter, [[YouTube]] and [[Facebook]] as a means of conveying messages about activist causes and organizing political movements.&lt;!-- [[Social movement theory]] / Digital social movement theory --&gt;

Research has also been done on how racial minorities and the use of technology by racial minorities and other groups.  These "'''digital practice'''" studies explore the ways in which the practices that groups adopt when using new technologies mitigate or reproduce social inequalities.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, R. (2014) ''The Digital Practices of African Americans: An Approach to Studying Cultural Change in the Information Society''. New York: Peter Lang.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Graham, R. (2016) "The Content of Our #Characters: Black Twitter as Counterpublic". ''Sociology of Race and Ethnicity'', 2(4) 433 – 449&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Digital data analysis ===
Digital sociologists use varied approaches to investigating people's use of digital media, both qualitative and quantitative. These include [[Ethnography|ethnographic research]], interviews and surveys with users of technologies, and also the analysis of the data produced from people's interactions with technologies: for example, their posts on social media platforms such as Facebook, [[Reddit]], [[4chan]], [[Tumblr]] and Twitter or their consuming habits on online shopping platforms. Such techniques as [[data scraping]], [[social network analysis]], [[time series analysis]] and [[textual analysis]] are employed to analyze both the data produced as a byproduct of users' interactions with digital media and those that they create themselves. 
For Contents Analysis, in 2008, Yukihiko Yoshida did a study called&lt;ref&gt;Yoshida, Yukihiko, Leni Riefenstahl and German Expressionism: A Study of Visual Cultural Studies Using Transdisciplinary Semantic Space of Specialized Dictionaries, Technoetic Arts: a journal of speculative research (Editor Roy Ascott), Volume 8, Issue3, intellect, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; "Leni Riefenstahl and German expressionism: research in Visual Cultural Studies using the trans-disciplinary semantic spaces of specialized dictionaries." The study took databases of images tagged with connotative and denotative keywords (a search engine) and found Riefenstahl's imagery had the same qualities as imagery tagged "degenerate" in the title of the exhibition, "Degenerate Art" in Germany at 1937.

The emergence of social media has provided sociologists with a new way of studying social phenomenon. Social media networks, such as [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]], are increasingly being mined for research. For example, Twitter data is easily available to researchers through the Twitter API. Twitter provides researchers with demographic data, time and location data, and connections between users. From these data, researchers gain insight into user moods and how they communicate with one another. Furthermore, social networks can be graphed and visualized.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Murthy|first1=Dhiraj|last2=Bowman|first2=Sawyer A|date=2014-11-25|title=Big Data solutions on a small scale: Evaluating accessible high-performance computing for social research|journal=Big Data &amp; Society|language=en|volume=1|issue=2|pages=205395171455910|doi=10.1177/2053951714559105|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using large data sets, like those obtained from Twitter, can be challenging. First of all, researchers have to figure out how to store this data effectively in a database. Several tools commonly used in [[Big data|Big Data]] analytics are at their disposal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Since large data sets can be unwieldy and contain numerous types of data (i.e. photos, videos, GIF images), researchers have the option of storing their data in non-relational databases, such as [[MongoDB]] and [[Apache Hadoop|Hadoop.]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Processing and querying this data is an additional challenge. However, there are several options available to researchers. One common option is to use a querying language, such as [[Apache Hive|Hive]], in conjunction with [[Apache Hadoop|Hadoop]] to analyze large data sets.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Internet and social media have allowed sociologists to study how controversial topics are discussed over time—otherwise known as Issue Mapping.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Marres|first1=Noortje|last2=Gerlitz|first2=Carolin|date=2015-08-14|title=Interface Methods: Renegotiating Relations between Digital Social Research, STS and Sociology|journal=The Sociological Review|language=en|volume=64|issue=1|pages=21–46|doi=10.1111/1467-954x.12314|s2cid=145741146|url=http://research.gold.ac.uk/11343/1/Marres__Gerlitz_interface_methods_revised%20final.pdf|access-date=2021-10-23|archive-date=2020-01-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200122215129/http://research.gold.ac.uk/11343/1/Marres__Gerlitz_interface_methods_revised%20final.pdf|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologists can search social networking sites (i.e. Facebook or Twitter) for posts related to a hotly-debated topic, then parse through and analyze the text.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Sociologists can then use a number of easily accessible tools to visualize this data, such as MentionMapp or Twitter [[Streamgraph]]. MentionMapp shows how popular a hashtag is and Twitter Streamgraph depicts how often certain words are paired together and how their relationship changes over time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Digital surveillance ==
Digital surveillance occurs when digital devices record people's daily activities, collecting and storing personal data, and invading privacy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; With the advancement of new technologies, the act of monitoring and watching people online has increased between the years of 2010 to 2020. The invasion of privacy and recording people without consent leads to people doubting the usage of technologies which are supposed to secure and protect personal information. The storage of data and intrusiveness in digital surveillance affects human behavior. The psychological implications of digital surveillance can cause people to have concern, worry, or fear about feeling monitored all the time. Digital data is stored within security technologies, apps, social media platforms, and other technological devices that can be used in various ways for various reasons. Data collected from people using the internet can be subject to being monitored and viewed by private and public companies, friends, and other known or unknown entities.

=== Critical digital sociology ===
This aspect of digital sociology is perhaps what makes it distinctive from other approaches to studying the digital world. In adopting a critical reflexive approach, sociologists are able to address the implications of the digital for sociological practice itself. It has been argued that digital sociology offers a way of addressing the changing relations between social relations and the analysis of these relations, putting into question what social research is, and indeed, what sociology is now as social relations and society have become in many respects mediated via digital technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Marres. N. (2013) [http://www.csisponline.net/2013/01/21/what-is-digital-sociology "What is digital sociology?"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211026171454/http://www.csisponline.net/2013/01/21/what-is-digital-sociology/ |date=2021-10-26 }} CSISP Online&lt;/ref&gt;

How should sociology respond to the emergent forms of both 'small data' and 'big data' that are collected in vast amounts as part of people's interactions with digital technologies and the development of data industries using these data to conduct their own social research? Does this suggest that a "coming crisis in empirical sociology" might be on the horizon?&lt;ref&gt;Savage, M. and Burrows, R. (2007) [https://www.gold.ac.uk/media/coming-crisis-empirical-sociology.pdf "The coming crisis of empirical sociology"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313031658/http://www.gold.ac.uk/media/coming-crisis-empirical-sociology.pdf |date=2013-03-13 }}. ''Sociology'', 41(5),885-889&lt;/ref&gt; How are the identities and work practices of sociologists themselves becoming implicated within and disciplined by digital technologies such as [[Citation impact|citation metrics]]?&lt;ref&gt;Burrows, R. (2012) Living with the h-index? Metric assemblages in the contemporary academy. ''The Sociological Review'', 60(2), 355—72.&lt;/ref&gt;

These questions are central to critical digital sociology, which reflects upon the role of sociology itself in the analysis of digital technologies as well as the impact of digital technologies upon sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Lupton, D. (2012) [http://simplysociology.wordpress.com/category/digital-sociology/page/2/ "Digital sociology part 3: digital research"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211026151733/https://simplysociology.wordpress.com/category/digital-sociology/page/2/ |date=2021-10-26 }}. This Sociological Life&lt;/ref&gt;

To these four aspects add the following subfields of digital sociology:

=== Public digital sociology ===
[[Public sociology]] using digital media is a form of public sociology that involves publishing sociological materials in online accessible spaces and subsequent interaction with publics in these spaces. This has been referred to as "e-public sociology".&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher J. Schneider]] (2014). Social Media and e-Public Sociology. In Ariane Hanemaayer and Christopher J. Schneider, editors, The Public Sociology Debate: Ethics and Engagement, University of British Columbia Press: 205-224&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media has changed the ways the public sociology was perceived and given rise to digital evolution in this field. The vast open platform of communication has provided opportunities for sociologists to come out from the notion of small group sociology or publics to a vast audience.

Blogging was the initial social media platform being utilized by sociologists. Sociologists like Eszter Hargittai, Chris Bertram, and Kieran Healy were few amongst those who started using blogging for sociology. New discussion groups about sociology and related philosophy were the consequences of social media impact. The vast number of comments and discussions thus became a part of understanding sociology. One of such famous groups was [http://crookedtimber.org/ Crooked Timber]. Getting feedback on such social sites is faster and impactful. Disintermediation, visibility, and measurement are the major effects of e-public sociology. Other social media tools like Twitter and Facebook also became the tools for a sociologist. [https://kieranhealy.org/files/papers/soc-social-media.pdf "Public Sociology in the Age of Social Media"].&lt;ref&gt;Healy, Kieran. "Public Sociology in the Age of Social Media." Berkeley Sociology Journal (2015): 1-16. APA&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Digital transformation of sociological theory ===
{{see also|Sociological theory}}
Information and communication technology as well as the proliferation of digital data are revolutionizing sociological research. Whereas there is already much methodological innovation in [[digital humanities]] and [[computational social sciences]], theory development in the social sciences and humanities still consists mainly of print theories of computer cultures or societies. These analogue theories of the digital transformation, however, fail to account for how profoundly the digital transformation of the social sciences and humanities is changing the epistemic core of these fields. Digital methods constitute more than providers of ever-''bigger'' digital datasets for testing of analogue theories, but also require new forms of digital theorising.&lt;ref&gt;Kitchin, R. "Big Data, new epistemologies and paradigm shifts." Big Data &amp; Society, 1(1) (2014): {{doi|10.1177/2053951714528481}}, APA&lt;/ref&gt; The ambition of research programmes on the digital transformation of [[social theory]] is therefore to translate analogue into digital social theories so as to complement traditional analogue social theories of the digital transformation by digital theories of digital societies.&lt;ref&gt;Roth S., Dahms H., Welz F., and Cattacin S. (2019) [https://derroth.com/2019/11/06/release-virtual-special-issue-digital-transformation-of-social-theory/ "Digital transformation of social theory"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211023142329/https://derroth.com/2019/11/06/release-virtual-special-issue-digital-transformation-of-social-theory/ |date=2021-10-23 }}.

'''Global Internet usage''' is the number of people who use the [[Internet]] worldwide.

{{Main |List of countries by number of Internet users}}
In 2015, the [[International Telecommunication Union]] estimated about 3.2 billion people, or almost half of the world's population, would be online by the end of the year. Of them, about 2 billion would be from developing countries, including 89 million from [[least developed country|least developed countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-32884867|title=Internet used by 3.2 billion people in 2015|work=BBC News|date=26 May 2015|via=bbc.com|access-date=21 July 2018|archive-date=18 September 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200918082455/https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-32884867|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Documents/facts/ICTFactsFigures2015.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150812085350/http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Documents/facts/ICTFactsFigures2015.pdf |date=2015-08-12 }} {{Bare URL PDF|date=March 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Hootsuite]], the number of Global Internet users has already reached almost 5 billion, or about 53% of the global population as of 2021.&lt;ref name="digital2020OctStatshot"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kemp |first1=Simon |title=Digital 2020: October Global Statshot |url=https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2020-october-global-statshot |website=Datareportal |date=20 October 2020 |publisher=Hootsuite |access-date=November 30, 2020 |archive-date=November 18, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201118175515/https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2020-october-global-statshot |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The flat world of information has been created thanks to the Internet and globalization.

'''Internet science''' is an interdisciplinary science that examines all aspects of the co-evolution in Internet networks and society. It works in the intersection of and in the gaps among a wide range of disciplines that have had to respond to the impact of the Internet on their 'home turf' and/or offer specific conceptual or methodological contributions. These include many [[natural science]]s (e.g., complexity science, [[computer science]], [[engineering]], [[Life Sciences|life sciences]], mathematics, physics, psychology, statistics, systems and [[evolutionary biology]]), [[social science]]s (e.g. anthropology, economics, philosophy, sociology, and political science), [[humanities]]  (e.g., art, history, linguistics, literature and history) and some existing interdisciplines that cross traditional Faculty boundaries (e.g., technology, medicine, law). Professor [[Noshir Contractor]] and others have located it at the intersection of [[computational social science]],&lt;ref&gt;Lazer, D.; Pentland, A.; Adamic, L.; Aral, S.; Barabasi, A. -L.; Brewer, D.; Christakis, N.; Contractor, N.; Fowler, J.; Gutmann, M.; Jebara, T.; King, G.; Macy, M.; Roy, D.; Van Alstyne, M. (2009). "SOCIAL SCIENCE: Computational Social Science". Science 323 (5915): 721–723&lt;/ref&gt; [[network science]], [[Computer network|network engineering]] and [[Web science]]. By understanding the role of society in shaping Internet networks and being shaped by them Internet science aims to take care of the Internet in a way similar to that in which Web science aims to take care of the Web.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Network Science, Web Science and Internet Science: comparing interdisciplinary areas - ePrints Soton|url = http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/376676/|website = eprints.soton.ac.uk| doi=10.1145/2699416 | s2cid=29757438 |accessdate = 2015-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lingua franca in this interdisciplinary area include Internet standards and associated implementation, social processes, Internet infrastructure and policy.

Many disciplines support Internet science with different analysis tools, designs, and languages. To have a productive and effective dialogue between disciplines requires incentives for cooperation. The three main elements of Internet science are: multidisciplinary convergence, [[observability]] and constructive experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.internet-science.eu/network-excellence-internet-science|title = The Network of Excellence In Internet Science|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Commission funded a ''Network of Excellence on Internet Science'' (project acronym [http://www.internet-science.eu/ EINS] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130608104203/http://internet-science.eu/ |date=2013-06-08 }}) over the period December 2011-May 2015 under the FP7 funding programme. The Network in May 2015 had 48 member universities and research organisations and 180 individual affiliate researchers. Two major international Internet science conferences&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Internet Science Conference 2015 - 27-29 May, Brussels|url = http://internetscienceconference.eu|website = 2nd Internet Science Conference|accessdate = 2015-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; were held in April 2013 and May 2015 together with an [[unconference]] at the [[University of Bologna#Affiliates and other institutions|University of Bologna]] in May 2014 and official workshops at international academic conferences such as [[Evolutionary psychology#Academic societies|Human Behavior and the Evolution of Society]] and international inter-governmental and multistakeholder conferences such as the 2013 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = From Mantra to Metrics: Measuring Multi-Stakeholderism (JRA4/JRA6/SEA2 workshop) Technical standards, law-making, and other governance instruments and metrics for a measurable impact of multi-stakeholderism {{!}} Network of Excellence in InterNet Science (EINS)|url = http://www.internet-science.eu/igf-workshop-2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; United Nations [[Internet Governance Forum]].

==Research==
Significant areas of current Internet science research include:

===Net neutrality===

[[Net neutrality]] is the rule where Internet service providers should treat all the traffic on their networks equally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://vpnreviews.online/what-does-net-neutrality-mean/ |title= What Does Net Neutrality Mean?|date= 23 October 2017|accessdate= October 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that companies should not slow down access or block any website content on the [[World Wide Web|Web]]. In the United States, high-speed Internet service providers (ISPs), including AT&amp;T, Comcast, Time Warner and Verizon, have sought support for a two-tiered Internet service model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/Net-neutrality|title = Net neutrality definition|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, President Obama announced a new plan to preserve "net neutrality" and to prevent Internet service providers from blocking or slowing websites or creating different tiers of speed. He said-, "No service should be stuck in a ‘slow lane’ because it does not pay a fee," he wrote in a statement. "That kind of gatekeeping would undermine the level playing field essential to the Internet’s growth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://journalistsresource.org/studies/society/internet/net-neutrality-debate-underlying-dynamics-research-perspectives|title = The net neutrality debate and underlying dynamics|date = 10 November 2014|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet privacy===

[[Internet privacy]] (online privacy) is an opportunity of individuals to regulate the flow of information and have access to data, which is generated during a browsing session. 

===Internet security===

Internet security includes things like [[phishing]], [[spyware]] and [[malware]].

===Sustainability===

[[Google Search|Google]] has signed two contracts with wind developers to power its data center in Finland with [[100% renewable energy]].&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/internet-sustainability-renewable-power|title = The internet can be a force for sustainability if powered by renewables|date = 5 February 2014|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = | newspaper=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook decided to build a data center in Iowa, and has helped drive the local energy provider to scrap plans to build a nuclear power plant, and instead build a $2bn(£1.23bn) wind farm, which has led to the biggest single order of wind turbines on record.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt;

===Internet as a socio-technical critical infrastructure===

Infrastructure provides a large range of vital services—such as the ability to move goods, people, and information.&lt;ref name="internet-science.eu"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.internet-science.eu/internet-critical-infrastructure|title = The Internet as Critical Infrastructure|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Infrastructural services like gas, electricity, water, transport, and banking are highly interconnected and mutually dependent in various complex ways.&lt;ref name="internet-science.eu"/&gt; They are linked physically, and through important ICT systems, to prevent breakdowns from escalating into whole infrastructure failure.

There is ongoing activity on the development of Internet Science curricula,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Deliverable 10.3: Description of Internet Science Curriculum {{!}} Network of Excellence in InterNet Science (EINS)|url = http://www.internet-science.eu/publication/934|website = www.internet-science.eu|accessdate = 2015-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; initially on a postgraduate level.

'''Digital inclusion''' involves the activities necessary to ensure equitable access to and use of [[Information and communications technology|information and communications technologies]] for participation in social and economic life including for education, social services, health, social, and community participation. Digital inclusion includes access to affordable broadband Internet services, Internet-enabled devices, access to [[digital literacy]] training, quality technical support, and applications and online content designed to enable and encourage self-sufficiency, participation, and collaboration. Related concepts include [[digital divide]], digital exclusion and digital inequality, however digital inclusion focuses more on the strategies, policies, and programs required to address the digital divide.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Wilson |first1=Chris K. |last2=Thomas |first2=Julian |last3=Barraket |first3=Jo |date=2019-06-30 |title=Measuring Digital Inequality in Australia: the Australian Digital Inclusion Index |url=https://jtde.telsoc.org/ |journal=Journal of Telecommunications and the Digital Economy |language=en |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=102–120 |doi=10.18080/jtde.v7n2.187 |s2cid=201305031 |issn=2203-1693|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As many services have moved online and with the increasing use of [[telehealth]] to deliver [[primary care]], particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, digital inclusion, including digital literacy and internet access is increasingly regarded as a [[Social determinants of health|social determinant of health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Sieck |first1=Cynthia J. |last2=Sheon |first2=Amy |last3=Ancker |first3=Jessica S. |last4=Castek |first4=Jill |last5=Callahan |first5=Bill |last6=Siefer |first6=Angela |date=2021 |title=Digital inclusion as a social determinant of health |journal=npj Digital Medicine |language=en |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=52 |doi=10.1038/s41746-021-00413-8 |issn=2398-6352 |pmc=7969595 |pmid=33731887}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accessibility, relevance, and impact have been identified as essential elements of digital inclusion as it pertains to health information systems.&lt;ref&gt;Washington, K.T., Oliver, D.P., Donehower, A.K., White, P., Benson, J.J., Lyons, P.G., &amp; Demiris, G.

"Digital inclusion is broadly defined as different strategies designed to ensure that all people have equal access, opportunities and skills to benefit from digital technologies and systems" (ITU, 2019, as cited in Carmi and Yates, 2020).

From 2020 to 2025 there have been a lot of different technology companies that want to help break that digital divide and start implementing different features or roles within their companies to support breaking down the digital divide bridge. For example, HP has announced the digital divide accelerator. This accelerator will support nonprofits in Greece, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Spain. The goal for this role is to help equip children and other people within the community to understand the skills needed to become a part of the digital community.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/hollycorbett/2025/02/26/3-ways-business-leaders-can-blend-profit-with-purpose/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
With the increasing use of computers and the Internet in the 1990s and early 2000s concerns rose around digital equality, however this primarily focused on the physical access to technology.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This gave rise to the concept of the digital divide which was originally developed to describe the growing disparity in Internet access between rural and urban areas of the United States of America. This gradually expanded to considerations of digital access between countries in what is termed the [[global digital divide]], which mirrors many of the disparities seen within countries but on an international scale. However with the adoption of digital technologies across most sectors of society, and the increasing diversity of technologies and programs, access and use of ICT became more complex and essential for many aspects of daily life. This led to new terminology and a second wave of research on digital inequality which has been identified as the (1) usage gap, (2) second level digital divide, (3) emerging digital differentiation, and (4) digital inclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Nemer |first=David |date=2015 |title=From Digital Divide to Digital Inclusion and Beyond |url=https://openjournals.uwaterloo.ca/index.php/JoCI/article/view/2857 |journal=The Journal of Community Informatics |volume=11 |issue=1 |doi=10.15353/joci.v11i1.2857 |issn=1712-4441|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Strategies for digital inclusion ==
A review of the literature in 2019 found that while physical access to digital technologies and the internet continues to be a barrier to digital inclusion, digital ability and attitude were also potential barriers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Borg |first1=Kim |last2=Boulet |first2=Mark |last3=Smith |first3=Liam |last4=Bragge |first4=Peter |date=2019-09-19 |title=Digital Inclusion &amp; Health Communication: A Rapid Review of Literature |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10410236.2018.1485077 |journal=Health Communication |language=en |volume=34 |issue=11 |pages=1320–1328 |doi=10.1080/10410236.2018.1485077 |pmid=29889560 |s2cid=48357756 |issn=1041-0236|url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt; Key strategies identified for improving digital inclusion are social support, direct user experience and collaborative learning/design.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Education is a key aspect of digital inclusion as digital technologies have become a key means of engaging with all levels of the education system, requiring levels of digital competence for successful engagement with the curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Hatlevik |first1=Ove Edvard |last2=Christophersen |first2=Knut-Andreas |date=2013-04-01 |title=Digital competence at the beginning of upper secondary school: Identifying factors explaining digital inclusion |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131512002801 |journal=Computers &amp; Education |language=en |volume=63 |pages=240–247 |doi=10.1016/j.compedu.2012.11.015 |issn=0360-1315|url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition [[lifelong learning]] is required as technologies, services and systems are changing constantly. [[Public library|Public libraries]] and community service providers play a key role in supporting digital inclusion through access to computers, internet connection and expertise and training.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Bertot |first=John Carlo |title=Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Theory and Practice of Electronic Governance |chapter=Building Digitally Inclusive Communities |date=2016 |chapter-url=https://doi.org/10.1145/2910019.2910082 |series= |location=New York, NY, USA |publisher=Association for Computing Machinery |pages=95–102 |doi=10.1145/2910019.2910082 |isbn=978-1-4503-3640-6|s2cid=9590149 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Designing for digital inclusion may also help with poor written literacy, which remains a barrier for 10% of the world's population. UNESCO has developed Guidelines for designing digital technologies in ways that could assist those who are illiterate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Vosloo |first=Steve |date=2018 |title=Designing inclusive digital solutions and developing digital skills: guidelines |url=https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000265537 |access-date=2022-03-15 |website=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Indigenous digital inclusion ==
Digital inclusion is a critical issue for many Indigenous communities across the globe, many of whom lack access to adequate resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Telecommunication Development Sector |date=30 Mar 2022 |title=Digital inclusion of indigenous peoples |url=https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Digital-Inclusion/Indigenous-Peoples/Pages/default.aspx |url-status=live |website=ITU {{!}} Committed to connecting the world|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210602214139/https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Digital-Inclusion/Indigenous-Peoples/Pages/default.aspx |archive-date=2021-06-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian Government has set a National Closing the Gap target for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to have equal levels of digital inclusion by 2026.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Closing the Gap targets and outcomes {{!}} Closing the Gap |url=https://www.closingthegap.gov.au/national-agreement/targets |access-date=2022-03-30 |website=www.closingthegap.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many people on tribal land and in Native Hawaiian land struggle with the technology gap. The Native Entities Capacity and Planning Grant Program has $45.3 million available to help address these challenges and empower Indian Tribes, Alaska Native entities, and Native Hawaiian organizations. Some of the impacts so far are in the education and workforce development and healthcare access through telehealth.[https://www.internetforall.gov/blog/celebrating-native-american-heritage-month-empowering-native-communities-through-digital [13&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]

== Measuring digital inclusion ==
The Australian Digital Inclusion Index (ADII) is a research project which has been tracking digital inclusion throughout Australia since 2016. It uses survey data to measure digital inclusion across three dimensions of access, affordability and digital ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Thomas |first1=Julian |last2=Barraket |first2=Jo |last3=Parkinson |first3=Sharon |last4=Wilson |first4=Chris K. |last5=Holcombe-James |first5=Indigo |last6=Kennedy |first6=Jenny |last7=Mannell |first7=Kate |last8=Brydon |first8=Abigail |date=2021-10-15 |title=Measuring Australia's digital divide: the Australian digital inclusion index 2021 |url=https://apo.org.au/node/314284 |journal= |language=en |publisher=RMIT University, Swinburne University and Telstra |doi=10.25916/phgw-b725}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Future of Digital Inclusion ==
On February 16, 2021, a global dialogue within the United Nations (UN) took a look at the future of digital inclusion. Through the adoption of the 2030 UN Agenda for Sustainable Development, Member States made a commitment. They pledged to "leave no one behind."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=February 16, 2021 |title=Digital Inclusion for All: Shaping our Digital Future |url=https://www.un.org/development/desa/dspd/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2021/02/Draft-DigitalInclusion4All-OnlineGlobalForum2021-12Feb.pdf |access-date=February 19, 2023 |website=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2030, the UN's goal is to close the digital divide by providing access to the Internet and mobile technologies for all nations and peoples and for all segments of society.

The UN sees the crisis of too many people in our global society still living unconnected and how the digital divide remains a challenge that must be addressed.

== Gaming ==
The [[Xbox Adaptive Controller]] is a groundbreaking example of digital inclusion, designed to make gaming more accessible to people with limited mobility. Developed by Microsoft, it features large programmable buttons and ports that connect to a wide range of external devices like switches, joysticks, and mounts, allowing users to customize their gaming experience based on their unique needs. By removing traditional physical barriers to gameplay, the Xbox Adaptive Controller empowers more people to participate in digital entertainment, promotes equal access to technology, and fosters a more inclusive gaming community.

The '''Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams''' ('''FIRST''') is a global forum of incident response and security teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams|url=https://icannwiki.org/Forum_of_Incident_Response_and_Security_Teams}}&lt;/ref&gt; They aim to improve cooperation between security teams on handling major cybersecurity incidents. FIRST is an association of incident response teams with global coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=GUIDANCE FOR IMPROVING THE COMPARABILITY OF STATISTICS PRODUCED BY COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT RESPONSE TEAMS CSIRTs)|url=https://one.oecd.org/document/DSTI/ICCP/REG(2013)9/FINAL/en/pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2018 Report of the United Nations Secretary-General's High-Level Panel on Digital Cooperation noted FIRST as a neutral third party which can help build trust and exchange best practices and tools during cybersecurity incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The age of digital interdependence|url=https://www.un.org/en/pdfs/DigitalCooperation-report-for%20web.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
FIRST was founded as an informal group by a number of incident response teams after the [[WANK (computer worm)]] highlighted the need for better coordination of incident response activities between organizations, during major incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Trusting Infrastructure: The Emergence of Computer Security Incident Response|journal=Technology and Culture |year=2020 |volume=61 |issue=1 |pages=173–206 |doi=10.1353/tech.2020.0036 |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/752964/pdf|last1=Slayton |first1=Rebecca |last2=Clarke |first2=Brian |pmid=32249219 |s2cid=214808905 |doi-access=free |url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was formally incorporated in California on August 7, 1995, and moved to North Carolina on May 14, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=North Carolina Secretary of State Search Results|url=https://www.sosnc.gov/online_services/Search/Business_Registration_profile?Id=10529500|access-date=2021-12-24|website=www.sosnc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==
In 2020, FIRST launched EthicsFIRST, a code of Ethics for Incident Response teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=FIRST launches new code of ethics for incident response and security teams on Global Ethics Day|url=https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/93703-first-launches-new-code-of-ethics-for-incident-response-and-security-teams-on-global-ethics-day|access-date=2022-01-01|website=www.securitymagazine.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Annually, FIRST offers a Suguru Yamaguchi Fellowship, which helps incident response teams with national responsibility gain further integration with the international incident response community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=2017-06-13|title=FIRST conference focuses on handling security breaches|url=https://newsismybusiness.com/conference-security-breaches/|access-date=2022-01-05|work=[[News Is My Business]]|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also maintains an Incident Response Hall of Fame, highlighting individuals who contributed significantly to the Incident Response community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Ian Cook and Don Stikvoort receive Incident Response Hall of Fame awards|url=https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/93468-ian-cook-and-don-stikvoort-receive-incident-response-hall-of-fame-awards|access-date=2022-01-05|website=www.securitymagazine.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FIRST maintains several international standards, including the [[Common Vulnerability Scoring System]], a standard for expressing impact of security vulnerabilities;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=What is the CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)?|url=https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/CVSS-Common-Vulnerability-Scoring-System|access-date=2022-01-01|website=SearchSecurity|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Traffic Light Protocol|Traffic light protocol]] for classifying sensitive information;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Darley|first1=Trey|last2=Schreck|first2=Thomas|date=2018-02-12|title=Why is Cyber Threat Intelligence Sharing Important?|url=https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/opinions/cyber-intelligence-sharing/|access-date=2022-01-01|website=Infosecurity Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Exploit Prediction Scoring System, an effort for predicting when software vulnerabilities will be exploited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Pompon|first=Raymond|date=2021-10-12|title=Prioritizing Vulnerability Management Using Machine Learning|url=https://www.f5.com/labs/articles/cisotociso/prioritizing-vulnerability-management-using-machine-learning|access-date=2022-01-05|website=F5 Labs|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FIRST is a partner of the [[International Telecommunication Union]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=First|url=https://www.itu.int:443/en/ITU-D/Cybersecurity/Pages/Global-Partners/first.aspx|access-date=2021-12-23|website=ITU|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; (ITU) and the [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade|Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade of Australia]] on Cybersecurity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams|url=https://www.dfat.gov.au/international-relations/themes/cyber-affairs/cyber-cooperation-program/Pages/forum-of-incident-response-and-security-teams|access-date=2022-01-01|website=Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ITU co-organizes with FIRST the Women in Cyber Mentorship Programme, which engages cybersecurity leaders in the field, and connects them with women worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Women in Cyber Mentorship Programme|url=https://www.itu.int:443/en/ITU-D/Cybersecurity/Pages/Women-in-Cyber/Women-in-Cyber-Mentorship-Programme.aspx|access-date=2022-01-03|website=ITU|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with the [[National Telecommunications and Information Administration]], FIRST also publishes guidelines for multi-party vulnerability disclosure, in scenarios such as the [[Heartbleed]] vulnerability in OpenSSL.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2020-05-18|title=FIRST updates guidelines for multi-party vulnerability disclosure|url=https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/first-updates-guidelines-for-multi-party-vulnerability-disclosure|access-date=2022-01-03|website=The Daily Swig {{!}} Cybersecurity news and views|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2019, the Wall Street Journal reported [[Huawei|Huawei Technologies Co.]] had been suspended from the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams due to changes to US technology export restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Isaac|first=Anna|date=2019-09-18|title=WSJ News Exclusive {{!}} Huawei Suspended From Global Forum Aimed at Combating Cybersecurity Breaches|language=en-US|work=Wall Street Journal|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/huawei-suspended-from-global-forum-aimed-at-combating-cyber-security-breaches-11568805324|access-date=2022-01-01|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, a NATO-style coalition of 41 states, including all [[Gulf Cooperation Council]] states, intended to work closely with FIRST to heighten levels of cybersecurity cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Seener|first=Barak|title=Trump's Saudi pivot is a golden opportunity in terror fight|url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/06/08/opinions/qatar-terrorism-fight-seener/index.html|access-date=2022-01-01|website=CNN|date=8 June 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Internet governance implications ==
In his study of Internet Governance, [[Joseph Nye]] identified FIRST as an "incident response regime", supporting global cyber activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nye|first=Joseph S.|date=2014|title=The Regime Complex for Managing Global Cyber Activities|url=https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/12308565|journal=Global Commission on Internet Governance|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political scientists focused on international security have considered organizations such as FIRST to be transparency and confidence-building measures in cyberspace, "elements of international policy that reduce threats, build trust, and make relationships between states more predictable".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Baseley-Walker|first=Ben|title=Transparency and confidence-building measures in cyberspace: towards norms of behaviour|url=https://citizenlab.ca/cybernorms2012/BaseleyWalker2011.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FIRST community has also been considered an example of "science diplomacy", as its technical community offers a means of navigating tensions in a way political actors re not able to.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Tanczer|first1=Leonie Maria|last2=Brass|first2=Irina|last3=Carr|first3=Madeline|date=2018|title=CSIRTs and Global Cybersecurity: How Technical Experts Support Science Diplomacy|journal=Global Policy|language=en|volume=9|issue=S3|pages=60–66|doi=10.1111/1758-5899.12625|s2cid=158740054 |issn=1758-5899|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Insider trading''' is the trading of a [[public company]]'s [[stock]] or other [[security (finance)|securities]] (such as [[bond (finance)|bonds]] or [[Option (finance)|stock options]]) based on material, nonpublic information about the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |access-date=18 October 2024 |title=FCA Handbook |url=https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/MAR/1/3.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In various countries, some kinds of trading based on insider information are illegal. The rationale for this prohibition of insider trading differs between countries and regions. Some view it as unfair to other investors in the market who do not have access to the information, as the investor with inside information could potentially make larger profits than an investor without such information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Directive 2014/57/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 on criminal sanctions for market abuse (market abuse directive) |date=2014-04-16 |volume=173 |url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32014L0057 |access-date=2024-10-18 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, insider trading is also prohibited to prevent the director of a company (the insider) from abusing a company's confidential information for the director's personal gain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Chiarella v. United States, 445 U.S. 222 (1980) |url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/445/222/ |access-date=2024-10-18 |website=Justia Law |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rules governing insider trading are complex and vary significantly from country to country as does the extent of enforcement. The definition of insider in one jurisdiction can be broad and may cover not only insiders themselves but also any persons related to them, such as brokers, associates, and even family members. In some jurisdictions, a person who becomes aware of [[market moving information|non-public information]] and trades on that basis may be guilty of a crime.

Trading by specific insiders, such as employees, is commonly permitted as long as it does not rely on material information not available to the general public. Many jurisdictions require that such trading be reported so that the transactions can be monitored. In the United States and several other jurisdictions, trading conducted by corporate officers, key employees, directors, or significant shareholders must be reported to the regulator or publicly disclosed, usually within a few business days of the trade. In these cases, insiders in the United States are required to file [[Form 4|Form&amp;nbsp;4]] with the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) when buying or selling shares of their own companies. The authors of one study claim that illegal insider trading raises the cost of capital for securities issuers, thus decreasing overall economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.fuqua.duke.edu/~charvey/Teaching/BA453_2005/BD_The_world.pdf "The World Price of Insider Trading"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180503043733/https://faculty.fuqua.duke.edu/~charvey/Teaching/BA453_2005/BD_The_world.pdf |date=2018-05-03 }} by [[Utpal Bhattacharya]] and [[Hazem Daouk]] in the [[Journal of Finance]], Vol. LVII, No. 1 (February 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Some economists, such as [[Henry Manne]], argued that insider trading should be allowed and could, in fact, benefit markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/07/26/insider-trading-makes-us-richer-better-informed-and-could-prevent-corporate-scandals-legalize-it/|title=Insider trading enriches and informs us, and could prevent scandals.

There has long been "considerable academic debate" among business and legal scholars over whether or not insider trading should be illegal.{{sfnp|Klein|Ramseyer|Bainbridge|2018|p=481}} Several arguments against outlawing insider trading have been identified: for example, although insider trading is illegal, most insider trading is never detected by law enforcement, and thus the illegality of insider trading might give the public the potentially misleading impression that "stock market trading is an unrigged game that anyone can play."{{sfnp|Klein|Ramseyer|Bainbridge|2018|p=481}} Some legal analysis has questioned whether insider trading actually harms anyone in the legal sense, since some have questioned whether insider trading causes anyone to suffer an actual "loss" and whether anyone who suffers a loss is owed an actual legal duty by the insiders in question.{{sfnp|Klein|Ramseyer|Bainbridge|2018|p=481}} Opponents of political insider trading point to [[conflict of interest]]s and social [[distrust]].&lt;ref name="c099"/&gt;

== Legal Framework ==
Rules prohibiting or criminalizing insider trading on material non-public information exist in most jurisdictions around the world (Bhattacharya and Daouk, 2002), but the details and the efforts to enforce them vary considerably. In the United States, Sections 16(b) and 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 directly and indirectly address insider trading. The U.S. Congress enacted this law after the stock market crash of 1929.&lt;ref name=Newkirk/&gt; While the United States is generally viewed as making the most serious efforts to enforce its insider trading laws,&lt;ref&gt;[https://ssrn.com/abstract=967482 "Law and the Market: The Impact of Enforcement"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110306000649/http://ssrn.com/abstract=967482 |date=2011-03-06 }} by John C. Coffee, University of Pennsylvania Law Review (December 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; the broader scope of the European model legislation provides a stricter framework against illegal insider trading.&lt;ref name="Masters" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ventoruzzo"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ventoruzzo |first=Marco |date=19 June 2014 |title=Comparing Insider Trading in the US and Europe |publisher=Harvard Law School |url=https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2014/06/19/comparing-insider-trading-in-the-us-and-europe/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630185840/http://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2014/06/19/comparing-insider-trading-in-the-us-and-europe/ |archive-date=30 June 2015 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the European Union and the United Kingdom, all trading on non-public information is, under the rubric of [[market abuse]], subject at a minimum to civil penalties and possible criminal penalties as well.&lt;ref name="Ventoruzzo" /&gt; UK's [[Financial Conduct Authority]] has the responsibility to investigate and prosecute insider dealing, defined by the [[Criminal Justice Act 1993]].

[[Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering]] (FATF) can apply to domestic [[politically exposed person]]s.&lt;ref name="FATF2013"&gt;{{Cite web |date=June 2013 |title=FATF Guidance: Politically Exposed Persons (Recommendations 12 and 22) |url=https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Fatfrecommendations/Peps-r12-r22.html |access-date=2023-06-25 |website=www.fatf-gafi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Definition of "insider"===
In the United States, Canada, Australia, Germany and Romania for mandatory reporting purposes, corporate insiders are defined as a company's officers, directors and any beneficial owners of more than 10% of a class of the company's equity securities. Trades made by these types of insiders in the company's own stock, based on material non-public information, are considered fraudulent since the insiders are violating the [[fiduciary duty]] that they owe to the shareholders. The corporate insider, simply by accepting employment, has undertaken a legal obligation to the shareholders to put the shareholders' interests before their own, in matters related to the corporation. When insiders buy or sell based on company-owned information, they are said to be violating their obligation to the shareholders or investors.

For example, illegal insider trading would occur if the [[chief executive officer]] of Company A learned (prior to a public announcement) that Company A would be taken over and then bought shares in Company A while knowing that the share price would likely rise. In the United States and many other jurisdictions, "insiders" are not just limited to corporate officials and major shareholders where illegal insider trading is concerned but can include any individual who trades shares based on material non-public information in violation of some duty of trust. This duty may be imputed; for example, in many jurisdictions, in cases where a corporate insider "tips" a friend about non-public information likely to have an effect on the company's share price, the duty the corporate insider owes the company is now imputed to the friend and the friend violates a duty to the company if he trades on the basis of this information.

===Liability===
Liability for inside trading violations generally cannot be avoided by passing on the information in an "I scratch your back; you scratch mine" or ''[[quid pro quo]]'' arrangement if the person receiving the information knew or should have known that the information was material non-public information. In the United States, at least one court has indicated that the insider who releases the non-public information must have done so for an improper purpose. In the case of a person who receives the insider information (called the "tippee"), the tippee must also have been aware that the insider released the information for an improper purpose.&lt;ref name="United States v 2014"&gt;''United States v. Newman'', 773 F.3d 438 (2d Cir. 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

One commentator has argued that if Company A's CEO did not trade on undisclosed [[takeover]] news, but instead passed the information on to his brother-in-law who traded on it, illegal insider trading would still have occurred (albeit by proxy, by passing it on to a "non-insider" so Company A's CEO would not get his hands dirty).&lt;ref name=Harris&gt;Larry Harris, Trading &amp; Exchanges, Oxford Press, Oxford, 2003. Chapter 29 "Insider Trading"&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|589}}

===Misappropriation theory===
The [[misappropriation]] theory of insider trading is now accepted in U.S. law. It states that anyone who misappropriates material non-public information and trades on that information in any stock may be guilty of insider trading. This can include elucidating material non-public information from an insider with the intention of trading on it or passing it on to someone who will. 
This theory constitutes the background for the securities regulation that enforces the insider trading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/about/oig/audit/aud311.pdf |title=Disgorgements |publisher=Securities and Exchange Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Disgorgement represents ill-gotten gains (or losses avoided) resulting from individuals violating the securities laws. 
In general in the countries where the insider trading is forbidden, the competent Authority seeks disgorgement to ensure that securities law violators do not profit from their illegal activity. 
When appropriate, the disgorged funds are returned to the injured investors. 
Disgorgements can be ordered in either administrative proceedings or civil actions, and the cases can be settled or litigated. Payment of disgorgement can be either completely or partially waived based on the defendant demonstrating an inability to pay. In settled administrative proceedings, Enforcement may recommend, if appropriate, that the disgorgement be waived.
There are several approaches in order to quantify the disgorgement; an innovative procedure based on [[probability theory]] was defined by Marcello Minenna by directly analyzing the time periods of the involved transactions in the insider trading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378426601002096 |title=Insider trading abnormal return and preferential information |journal=Journal of Banking and Finance  |date=January 2003 |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=59–86 |doi=10.1016/S0378-4266(01)00209-6 |last1=Minenna |first1=Marcello |url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proof of responsibility===
Proving that someone has been responsible for a trade can be difficult because traders may try to hide behind nominees, offshore companies, and other proxies. The SEC prosecutes over 50 cases each year, with many being settled administratively out of court. The SEC and several [[stock exchange]]s actively monitor trading, looking for suspicious activity.&lt;ref name=cox&gt;{{cite web |last=Cox |first=Charles C. |title=The Law of Insider Trading - How they get caught |url=https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1986/112086cox.pdf |publisher=Securities and Exchange Commission |access-date=2014-03-23 |date=1986-11-20 |archive-date=2019-04-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190412164311/https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1986/112086cox.pdf |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Levine |first=Matt |title=SEC Insider Trading Investigation Reveals SEC Is Really Good At Insider Trading Investigations, Anyway |url=http://dealbreaker.com/2013/01/sec-insider-trading-investigation-reveals-sec-is-really-good-at-insider-trading-investigations-anyway/ |work=Dealbreaker |access-date=2014-03-23 |archive-date=2019-04-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190409141331/https://dealbreaker.com/2013/01/sec-insider-trading-investigation-reveals-sec-is-really-good-at-insider-trading-investigations-anyway |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Market Surveillance |url=https://www.nyse.com/regulation/memberorganizations/1022221394213.html |publisher=NYSE EuroNext |access-date=March 23, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070624062204/http://www.nyse.com/regulation/memberorganizations/1022221394213.html |archive-date=June 24, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The SEC does not have criminal enforcement authority but can refer serious matters to the U.S. Attorney's Office for further investigation and prosecution.

===Trading on information in general===
In the United States and most non-European jurisdictions, not all trading on non-public information is illegal insider trading.&lt;ref name="Ventoruzzo" /&gt; For example, a person in a restaurant who hears the CEO of Company A at the next table tell the CFO that the company's profits will be higher than expected and then buys the stock is not guilty of insider trading—unless he or she had some closer connection to the company or company officers.&lt;ref name="Shell"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Shell |first=G.

Notwithstanding, information about a [[tender offer]] (usually regarding a merger or acquisition) is held to a higher standard. If this type of information is obtained (directly or indirectly) and there is reason to believe it is nonpublic, there is a duty to disclose it or abstain from trading.&lt;ref&gt;17 C.F.R. 240.14e-3&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States in addition to civil penalties, the trader may also be subject to criminal prosecution for fraud or where SEC regulations have been broken, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) may be called to conduct an independent parallel investigation. If the DOJ finds criminal wrongdoing, the department may file criminal charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Raiser|first=Steve|title=Raiser &amp; Kenniff|url=http://www.raiserkenniff.com.php53-5.dfw1-2.websitetestlink.com/insider-trading-when-is-it-civil-or-criminal/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105020113/http://www.raiserkenniff.com.php53-5.dfw1-2.websitetestlink.com/insider-trading-when-is-it-civil-or-criminal/|archive-date=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commercialisation===
The advent of the Internet has provided a forum for the [[commercialisation]] of trading on insider information. In 2016 a number of [[dark web]] sites were identified as marketplaces where such non-public information was bought and sold. At least one such site used [[bitcoin]] to avoid currency restrictions and to impede tracking. Such sites also provide a place for soliciting for corporate informants, where non-public information may be used for purposes&lt;ref&gt;Such purposes include [[competitor analysis]] for [[competitive advantage]], providing a basis for [[sabotage]], and gaining advantage in [[Intragroup conflict|internicine feuding]].&lt;/ref&gt; other than stock trading.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Uchill |first=Joe |date=1 February 2017 |title=Report: Leakers sell inside trading tips on dark web |newspaper=The Hill |url=https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/317377-report-leakers-sell-inside-trading-tips-on-dark-web/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214195423/http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/317377-report-leakers-sell-inside-trading-tips-on-dark-web |archive-date=14 February 2017 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arguments for further prohibition===
A study of political insider trading found existing regulation including [[STOCK Act]] results in [[conflict of interest]] and contributes to social [[distrust]].&lt;ref name="c099"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hanousek | first=Jan | last2=Jo | first2=Hoje | last3=Pantzalis | first3=Christos | last4=Park | first4=Jung Chul | title=A Dilemma of Self-interest vs. Ethical Responsibilities in Political Insider Trading | journal=Journal of Business Ethics | volume=187 | issue=1 | date=2023 | issn=0167-4544 | pmid=36259070 | pmc=9560883 | doi=10.1007/s10551-022-05265-0 | doi-access=free | pages=137–167}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Information asymmetry]] enjoyed by politicians was found to be high, which does not confirm the predictions of [[social contract]] theory.&lt;ref name="c099"/&gt; Political insider trading by persons which are not required to report according to [[STOCK Act]] was found.&lt;ref name="c099"/&gt; Higher insider trading was found when [[legislature]] is in session and in periods with higher [[Political risk#Geopolitical risk|geopolitical risk]].&lt;ref name="h933"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Karadas | first=Serkan | last2=Schlosky | first2=Minh Tam Tammy | title=What explains trading behaviors of members of congress?

==Legal==
Legal trades by insiders are common,&lt;ref name=Newkirk&gt;Thomas Newkirk. (1998). [https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/speecharchive/1998/spch221.htm Speech by SEC Staff: Insider Trading – A U.S. Perspective] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171119121933/https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/speecharchive/1998/spch221.htm |date=2017-11-19 }}. 16th International Symposium on Economic Crime at Jesus College, Cambridge, England on September 19, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; as employees of [[public company|publicly traded]] [[corporation]]s often have stock or stock options. These trades are made public in the United States through [[SEC filing]]s that are also being made available by academic researchers as structured datasets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Balogh |first1=Attila |date=26 April 2023 |title=Insider trading |url=https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-023-02147-6 |journal=Scientific Data |volume=10 |issue=237 |page=237 |doi=10.1038/s41597-023-02147-6 |pmid=37185601 |access-date=3 May 2024|pmc=10130014 |bibcode=2023NatSD..10..237B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Balogh |first1=Attila |date=3 May 2024 |title=Layline insider trading dataset |url=https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/VH6GVH |journal=Harvard Dataverse |doi=10.7910/DVN/VH6GVH |access-date=3 May 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. [[SEC Rule 10b5-1]] clarified that the prohibition against insider trading does not require proof that an insider actually used material nonpublic information when conducting a trade; possession of such information alone is sufficient to violate the provision, and the SEC would infer that an insider in possession of material nonpublic information used this information when conducting a trade. However, SEC Rule 10b5-1 also created for insiders an [[affirmative defense]] if the insider can demonstrate that the trades conducted on behalf of the insider were conducted as part of a pre-existing [[contract]] or written binding plan for trading in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rule-10b5-1.asp|title=Rule 10b5-1|date=Sep 17, 2019|website=Investopedia|url-status=live|access-date=February 9, 2020|archive-date=February 4, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200204170810/https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rule-10b5-1.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, if an insider expects to retire after a specific period of time and, as part of retirement planning, the insider has adopted a written binding plan to sell a specific amount of the company's stock every month for two years, and the insider later comes into possession of material nonpublic information about the company, trades based on the original plan might not constitute prohibited insider trading.

There are very limited laws against "insider trading" in the commodities markets if, for no other reason than that the concept of an "insider" is not immediately analogous to commodities themselves (corn, wheat, steel, etc.). However, analogous activities such as [[front running]] are illegal under US commodity and [[futures trading]] laws. For example, a [[commodity broker]] can be charged with fraud for receiving a large purchase order from a client (one likely to affect the price of that commodity) and then purchasing that commodity before executing the client's order to benefit from the anticipated price increase.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}

===Arguments for legalizing===
Some economists and legal scholars (such as [[Henry Manne]], [[Milton Friedman]], [[Thomas Sowell]], [[Daniel Fischel]], and [[Frank H. Easterbrook]]) have argued that laws against insider trading should be repealed. They claim that insider trading based on material nonpublic information benefits investors, in general, by more quickly introducing new information into the market.{{Citation needed|date=November 2024}}

Friedman, laureate of the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics]], said: "You want more insider trading, not less. You want to give the people most likely to have knowledge about deficiencies of the company an incentive to make the public aware of that." Friedman did not believe that the trader should be required to make his trade known to the public, because the buying or selling pressure itself is information for the market.&lt;ref name="Harris" /&gt;{{rp|591–7}}

Others argue that insider trading is a victimless act: a willing buyer and a willing seller agree to trade property that the seller rightfully owns, with no prior contract (according to this view) having been made between the parties to refrain from trading if there is [[asymmetric information]]. ''[[The Atlantic]]'' has described the process as "arguably the closest thing that modern finance has to a victimless crime".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Megan |last=McArdle |author-link=Megan McArdle |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/11/capitol-gains/8692/ |title=Capitol Gains – Magazine |magazine=The Atlantic |date=October 3, 2011 |access-date=December 21, 2011 |archive-date=June 14, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614135908/http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/11/capitol-gains/8692/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legalization advocates also question why "trading" where one party has more information than the other is legal in other markets, such as [[real estate]], but not in the stock market. For example, if a [[geologist]] knows there is a high likelihood of the discovery of petroleum under Farmer Smith's land, he may be entitled to make Smith an offer for the land, and buy it, without first telling Farmer Smith of the geological data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=18 U.S. Code § 1905 - Disclosure of confidential information generally|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1905|access-date=2020-11-05|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|archive-date=2020-11-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201111170229/https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1905|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates of legalization make [[free speech]] arguments. Punishment for communicating about a development pertinent to the next day's stock price might seem an act of censorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.walterblock.com/wp-content/uploads/publications/information_privilege.pdf |title="Information, Privilege, Opportunity, and Insider Trading" in the Northern Illinois University Law Review |access-date=January 7, 2013 |archive-date=April 12, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190412164119/http://www.walterblock.com/wp-content/uploads/publications/information_privilege.pdf |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors have used these arguments to propose legalizing insider trading on negative information (but not on positive information). Since negative information is often withheld from the market, trading on such information has a higher value for the market than trading on positive information.&lt;ref&gt;Kristoffel Grechenig, The Marginal Incentive of Insider Trading: An Economic Reinterpretation of the Case Law, University of Memphis Law Review 2006, vol. 37,  p. 75-148 [https://ssrn.com/abstract=883642 (link)].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Macey, Jonathan.

==Legal differences among jurisdictions==
The US and the UK differ in the way the law is interpreted and applied with regard to insider trading. In the UK, the relevant laws are the [[Criminal Justice Act 1993]], Part V, Schedule 1; the [[Financial Services and Markets Act 2000]], which defines an offence of "[[market abuse]]";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Alexander |first=Kern |title=Insider Dealing and Market Abuse: The Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 |publisher=Centre for Business Research, University of Cambridge |date=December 2001 |url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/7151265.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215195343/https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/7151265.pdf |archive-date=15 February 2017 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the European Union Regulation No 596/2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 on market abuse | url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32014R0596 | access-date=15 February 2017 | archive-date=16 February 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216053324/http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32014R0596 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Market abuse |publisher=Financial Conduct Authority (FCU) |url=https://www.fca.org.uk/markets/market-abuse |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109173744/https://www.fca.org.uk/markets/market-abuse |archive-date=9 November 2016 |url-status=live|date=2016-05-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle is that it is illegal to trade on the basis of market-sensitive information that is not generally known.  This is a much broader scope than under U.S. law. The key differences from U.S. law are that no relationship to either the issuer of the security or the tipster is required; all that is required is that the guilty party traded (or caused trading) whilst having inside information, and there is no ''[[scienter]]'' requirement under UK law.&lt;ref name="Masters"&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Masters |first1=Brooke |last2=McCrum |first2=Dan |date=26 January 2012 |title=Gulf between US and UK 'insider trading' |newspaper=[[Financial Times]] |url=https://www.ft.com/content/d2f943ae-4811-11e1-a4e5-00144feabdc0 |url-access=subscription |access-date=15 February 2017 |archive-date=1 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180701182854/https://www.ft.com/content/d2f943ae-4811-11e1-a4e5-00144feabdc0 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Market Abuse) – Regulations 2016 |publisher=Government of the United Kingdom |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2016/680/pdfs/uksi_20160680_en.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214202307/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2016/680/pdfs/uksi_20160680_en.pdf |archive-date=14 February 2017 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first1=Caroline |last1=Binham |first2=Martin |last2=Arnold |title=Bank of England governor Mark Carney to extend market abuse rules |date=11 June 2015 |newspaper=Financial Times |url=https://www.ft.com/content/d24ce466-0f8b-11e5-b968-00144feabdc0 |url-access=subscription |access-date=14 February 2017 |archive-date=19 May 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180519050956/https://www.ft.com/content/d24ce466-0f8b-11e5-b968-00144feabdc0 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Organization of Securities Commissions]] (IOSCO) paper on the "Objectives and Principles of Securities Regulation" (updated to 2003)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD154.pdf |title=Objectives and Principles of Securities Regulation |publisher=[[International Organization of Securities Commissions]] (IOSCO) |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050829080215/http://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD154.pdf |archive-date=29 August 2005 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that the three objectives of good securities market regulation are investor protection, ensuring that markets are fair, efficient and transparent, and reducing [[systemic risk]].

The discussion of these "Core Principles" state that "investor protection" in this context means "Investors should be protected from misleading, manipulative or fraudulent practices, including insider trading, front running or trading ahead of customers and the misuse of client assets." More than 85 percent of the world's securities and commodities market regulators are members of IOSCO and have signed on to these Core Principles.

The [[World Bank]] and [[International Monetary Fund]] now use the IOSCO Core Principles in reviewing the financial health of different country's regulatory systems as part of these organization's financial sector assessment program, so laws against insider trading based on non-public information are now expected by the international community. Enforcement of insider trading laws varies widely from country to country, but the vast majority of jurisdictions now outlaw the practice, at least in principle.

Larry Harris claims that differences in the effectiveness with which countries restrict insider trading help to explain the differences in [[executive compensation]] among those countries. The US, for example, has much higher CEO salaries than have Japan or Germany, where insider trading is less effectively restrained.&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt;{{rp|593}}

==By nation==

===Australia===
The current Australian legislation arose out of the report of a 1989 parliamentary committee report which recommended removal of the requirement that the trader be 'connected' with the body corporate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Duffy |first=M |title=Insider Trading: Addressing the Continuing Problems of Proof |year=2009 |volume=23 |issue=2 |page=149 |journal=Australian Journal of Corporate Law |ssrn=3192201}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This may have weakened the importance of the fiduciary duty rationale and possibly brought new potential offenders within its ambit.  In Australia if a person possesses inside information and knows, or ought reasonably to know, that the information is not generally available and is materially price sensitive then the insider must not trade.  Nor must she or he procure another to trade and must not tip another.  Information will be considered generally available if it consists of readily observable matter or it has been made known to common investors and a reasonable period for it to be disseminated among such investors has elapsed.{{cn|date=June 2025}}

===Brazil===
The practice of insider trading is an illegal act under Brazilian law, since it constitutes unfair behavior that threatens the security and equality of legal conditions in the market.

The then member of the board of directors Romano Ancelmo Fontana Filho was sentenced to prison for one year and five months in an open regime, also replaceable by community service, in addition to not being able to exercise the position of administrator or fiscal councilor of a publicly-held company.

These crimes were explored in [[Mark Coakley]]'s 2011 non-fiction book, ''[[Tip and Trade]]''.

===China===
The majority of shares in China before 2005 were non-tradeable shares that were not sold on the stock exchange publicly but privately. To make shares more accessible, the China Securities Regulation Commission (CSRC) required the companies to convert the non-tradeable shares into tradeable shares. There was a deadline for companies to convert their shares and the deadline was short, and due to this there was a large amount of exchanges, and many of these were conducted based on critical inside information. At the time, insider trading did not lead to prison time. Generally, punishment may include monetary fees or temporary relieving from a position in the company, but prison time is rare. However, in 2015, the Chinese fund manager [[Xu Xiang]] was arrested for insider trading, and in 2017, he was sentenced to five and a half years in prison and fined 11 [[billion]] [[Yuan (currency)|yuan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/top-fund-manager-nabbed-in-china-graft-probe|title=Top fund manager nabbed in China graft probe |date=2015-11-04 |work=[[The Straits Times]] |access-date=2015-11-23 |archive-date=2018-01-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180107131746/http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/top-fund-manager-nabbed-in-china-graft-probe |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union===
In 2014, the European Union (EU) adopted legislation (Criminal Sanctions for Market Abuse Directive) that harmonised criminal sanctions for insider dealing. All EU Member States agreed to introduce maximum prison sentences of at least four years for serious cases of [[market manipulation]] and insider dealing, and at least two years for improper disclosure of insider information.&lt;ref&gt;Hauck, P., [http://www.zis-online.com/dat/artikel/2015_6_930.pdf Europe's commitment to countering insider dealing and market manipulation on the basis of Art. 83 para. 2 TFEU; A critical evaluation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190412164310/http://www.zis-online.com/dat/artikel/2015_6_930.pdf |date=2019-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
Insider trading in India is an offense according to Sections 12A and 15G of the [[Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992]], and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 2015. Insider trading is when one with access to non-public, price-sensitive information about the securities of the company subscribes, buys, sells, or deals, or agrees to do so or counsels another to do so as principal or agent. Price-sensitive information is information that materially affects the value of the securities. The penalty for insider trading is imprisonment, which may extend to five years, and a minimum of five [[lakh]] [[rupee]]s (500,000) to 25 [[crore]] rupees (250&amp;nbsp;million) or three times the profit made, whichever is higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=The Companies Act |year=2013 |publisher=Ministry Of Corporate Affairs, Government of India |url=http://www.mca.gov.in/Ministry/pdf/CompaniesAct2013.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205215453/http://mca.gov.in/Ministry/pdf/CompaniesAct2013.pdf |archive-date=5 December 2013 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Wall Street Journal'', in a 2014 article entitled "Why It's Hard to Catch India's Insider Trading", said that despite a widespread belief that insider trading takes place on a regular basis in India, there were few examples of insider traders being prosecuted in India.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2014/04/21/why-is-it-tough-to-catch-insider-trading-in-india/| title=Why It's Hard to Catch India's Insider Trading| newspaper=Wall Street Journal| date=21 April 2014| access-date=23 August 2019| archive-date=23 August 2019| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190823064045/https://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2014/04/21/why-is-it-tough-to-catch-insider-trading-in-india/| url-status=live| last1=Machado| first1=Kenan}}&lt;/ref&gt; One former top regulator said that in India insider trading is deeply rooted and especially rampant because regulators do not have the tools to address it.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; In the few cases where prosecution has taken place, cases have sometimes taken more than a decade to reach trial, and punishments have been light; and despite SEBI by law having the ability to demand penalties of up to $4&amp;nbsp;million, the few fines that were levied for insider trading have usually been under $200,000.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;

===United Kingdom===
{{see also|UK company law}}
Although insider trading in the UK has been illegal since 1980, it proved difficult to successfully prosecute individuals accused of insider trading. There were a number of notorious cases where individuals were able to escape prosecution. Instead the UK regulators relied on a series of fines to punish market abuses.

These fines were widely perceived as an ineffective deterrent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cole|first=Margaret|title=Insider dealing in the City|url=http://www.fsa.gov.uk/library/communication/speeches/2007/0317_mc.shtml|work=Financial Services Authority|access-date=December 28, 2012|archive-date=February 5, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205144454/http://www.fsa.gov.uk/library/communication/speeches/2007/0317_mc.shtml|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there was a statement of intent by the UK regulator (the Financial Services Authority) to use its powers to enforce the legislation (specifically the [[Financial Services and Markets Act 2000]]). Between 2009 and 2012 the FSA secured 14 convictions in relation to insider dealing.

===United States===

====United States law====
Until the 21st century and the European Union's [[market abuse]] laws, the United States was the leading country in prohibiting insider trading made on the basis of material non-public information.&lt;ref name="Ventoruzzo" /&gt; Thomas Newkirk and Melissa Robertson of the SEC summarize the development of US insider trading laws.&lt;ref name=Newkirk/&gt; Insider trading has a base offense level of 8, which puts it in Zone&amp;nbsp;A under the [[U.S. Sentencing Guidelines]]. This means that first-time offenders are eligible to receive probation rather than incarceration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S.S.G. §2B1.4 |url=http://www.ussc.gov/2009guid/2b1_4.htm  |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618144017/http://www.ussc.gov/2009guid/2b1_4.htm |archive-date=2010-06-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Statutory====
U.S. insider trading prohibitions are based on English and American common law prohibitions against fraud. In 1909, well before the Securities Exchange Act was passed, the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled that a corporate director who bought that company's stock when he knew the stock's price was about to increase committed fraud by buying but not disclosing his inside information.

Section 15 of the [[Securities Act of 1933]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/about/laws/sa33.pdf |title=Securities Exchange Act of 1933 |access-date=December 21, 2011 |archive-date=January 11, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111084531/http://www.sec.gov/about/laws/sa33.pdf |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; contained prohibitions of fraud in the sale of securities, later greatly strengthened by the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/about/laws/sea34.pdf |title=Securities Exchange Act of 1934 |access-date=December 21, 2011 |archive-date=January 14, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114052905/http://www.sec.gov/about/laws/sea34.pdf |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 prohibits short-swing profits (from any purchases and sales within any six-month period) made by corporate directors, officers, or stockholders owning more than 10% of a firm's shares. Under Section 10(b) of the 1934 Act, [[SEC Rule 10b-5]], prohibits fraud related to securities trading.

The Insider Trading Sanctions Act of 1984 and the Insider Trading and Securities Fraud Enforcement Act of 1988 place penalties for illegal insider trading as high as three times the amount of profit gained or loss avoided from illegal trading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Thomsen LT|url=https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/2006/ts092606lct.htm|title=Testimony Concerning Insider Trading|publisher=SEC|access-date=December 21, 2011|archive-date=September 21, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180921022213/https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/2006/ts092606lct.htm|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====SEC regulations====
SEC [[Regulation Fair Disclosure|regulation FD ("Fair Disclosure")]] requires that if a company intentionally discloses material non-public information to one person, it must simultaneously disclose that information to the public at large. In the case of unintentional disclosure of material non-public information to one person, the company must make a public disclosure "promptly".&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt;{{rp|586}}

Insider trading, or similar practices, are also regulated by the SEC under its rules on takeovers and tender offers under the [[Williams Act]].

====Court decisions====
Much of the development of insider trading law has resulted from court decisions.

In 1909, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in ''Strong v. Repide''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/213/419/ |title=Strong v. Repide – 213 U.S. 419 (1909) :: Justia US Supreme Court Center |publisher=Supreme.justia.com |access-date=August 20, 2012 |archive-date=January 7, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107050911/http://supreme.justia.com/us/213/419/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; that a director who expects to act in a way that affects the value of shares cannot use that knowledge to acquire shares from those who do not know of the expected action. Even though, in general, ordinary relations between directors and shareholders in a business corporation are not of such a fiduciary nature as to make it the duty of a director to disclose to a shareholder general knowledge regarding the value of the shares of the company before he purchases any from a shareholder, some cases involve special facts that impose such duty.

In 1968, the [[Second Circuit Court of Appeals]] advanced a "level playing field" theory of insider trading in ''[[SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co.|SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co]].''&lt;ref&gt;''[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8550821722818303653 Securities and Exchange Com'n v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205144453/http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8550821722818303653 |date=2016-02-05 }}'', 401 F. 2d 833 (2d Cir. 1968)&lt;/ref&gt; The court stated that anyone in possession of inside information must either disclose the information or refrain from trading. Officers of the [[Texas Gulf Sulfur Company|Texas Gulf Sulphur Company]] had used inside information about the discovery of the [[Kidd Mine]] to make profits by buying shares and call options on company stock.&lt;ref name=brooks&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Brooks|first=John|title=A Reasonable Amount of Time|magazine=The New Yorker|date=November 9, 1968|pages=160–188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in the case of ''Dirks v. Securities and Exchange Commission''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=463&amp;invol=646 |title=FindLaw &amp;#124; Cases and Codes |publisher=Caselaw.lp.findlaw.com |access-date=August 20, 2012 |archive-date=May 20, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520004927/http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=463&amp;invol=646 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; that tippees (receivers of second-hand information) are liable if they had reason to believe that the tipper had breached a fiduciary duty in disclosing confidential information. One such example would be if the tipper received any personal benefit from the disclosure, thereby breaching his or her duty of loyalty to the company. In ''Dirks'', the "tippee" received confidential information from an insider, a former employee of a company. The reason the insider disclosed the information to the tippee, and the reason the tippee disclosed the information to third parties, was to blow the whistle on massive fraud at the company. As a result of the tippee's efforts the fraud was uncovered, and the company went into bankruptcy. But, while the tippee had given the "inside" information to clients who made profits from the information, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the tippee could not be held liable under the federal securities laws—for the simple reason that the insider from whom he received the information was not releasing the information for an improper purpose (a personal benefit), but rather for the purpose of exposing the fraud. The Supreme Court ruled that the tippee could not have been aiding and abetting a securities law violation committed by the insider—for the simple reason that no securities law violation had been committed by the insider.

(In 2019, in the case of ''United States v. Blaszczak'', the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that the “personal-benefit” test announced in ''Dirks'' does not apply to Title 18 fraud statutes, such as 18 USC 1348.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCOURTS-ca2-18-02867/pdf/USCOURTS-ca2-18-02867-0.pdf|title=United States v.

In ''Dirks'', the Supreme Court also defined the concept of "constructive insiders", who are lawyers, investment bankers, and others who receive confidential information from a corporation while providing services to the corporation. Constructive insiders are also liable for insider trading violations if the corporation expects the information to remain confidential, since they acquire the fiduciary duties of the true insider.

The next expansion of insider trading liability came in ''SEC vs. Materia''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://leagle.com/decision/1984942745F2d197_1924.xml/S.E.C.%20v.%20MATERIA |title=S.E.C. V. Materia |publisher=Leagle.com |access-date=March 3, 2014 |archive-date=January 3, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170103000348/http://www.leagle.com/decision/1984942745F2d197_1924.xml/S.E.C. |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; 745 F.2d 197 (2d Cir. 1984), the case that first introduced the misappropriation theory of liability for insider trading. Materia, a financial printing firm proofreader, and clearly not an insider by any definition, was found to have determined the identity of takeover targets based on proofreading tender offer documents in the course of his employment. After a two-week trial, the district court found him liable for insider trading, and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed holding that the theft of information from an employer, and the use of that information to purchase or sell securities in another entity, constituted a fraud in connection with the purchase or sale of a securities. The misappropriation theory of insider trading was born, and liability further expanded to encompass a larger group of outsiders.

In ''United States v. Carpenter''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=484&amp;invol=19 |title=FindLaw &amp;#124; Cases and Codes |publisher=Caselaw.lp.findlaw.com |access-date=August 20, 2012 |archive-date=September 7, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907221113/http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=484&amp;invol=19 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; (1986) the U.S. Supreme Court cited an earlier ruling while unanimously upholding mail and wire fraud convictions for a defendant who received his information from a journalist rather than from the company itself. The journalist [[R. Foster Winans]] was also convicted, on the grounds that he had misappropriated information belonging to his employer, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''. In that widely publicized case, Winans traded in advance of "Heard on the Street" columns appearing in the Journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Christopher |last=Cox |author-link=Christopher Cox |publisher=U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission |url=https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2006/spch050106cc.htm |title=Speech by SEC Chairman: Remarks at the Annual Meeting of the Society of American Business Editors and Writers |access-date=2017-09-01 |archive-date=2016-06-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160608143447/http://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2006/spch050106cc.htm |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court stated in ''Carpenter'': "It is well established, as a general proposition, that a person who acquires special knowledge or information by virtue of a confidential or fiduciary relationship with another is not free to exploit that knowledge or information for his own personal benefit but must account to his principal for any profits derived therefrom."

However, in upholding the securities fraud (insider trading) convictions, the justices were evenly split.

In 1997, the U.S. Supreme Court adopted the misappropriation theory of insider trading in ''United States v. O'Hagan'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/96-842.ZO.html |title=United States v. O'Hagan, 117 S.Ct. 2199, 138 L.Ed.2d 724 (1997) |publisher=Law.cornell.edu |access-date=August 20, 2012 |archive-date=January 7, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180107174916/https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/96-842.ZO.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; 521 U.S. 642, 655 (1997). O'Hagan was a partner in a law firm representing [[Diageo|Grand Metropolitan]], while it was considering a tender offer for [[Pillsbury Company]]. O'Hagan used this inside information by buying call options on Pillsbury stock, resulting in profits of over $4.3&amp;nbsp;million. O'Hagan claimed that neither he nor his firm owed a fiduciary duty to Pillsbury, so he did not commit fraud by purchasing Pillsbury options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.law.com/regionals/ca/briefing/wilson/wilson21.html |title=Law.com |publisher=Law.com |date=June 25, 1997 |access-date=December 21, 2011 |archive-date=November 4, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091104140351/http://www.law.com/regionals/ca/briefing/wilson/wilson21.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court rejected O'Hagan's arguments and upheld his conviction.

The "misappropriation theory" holds that a person commits fraud "in connection with" a securities transaction and thereby violates 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, when he misappropriates confidential information for securities trading purposes, in breach of a duty owed to the source of the information. Under this theory, a fiduciary's undisclosed, self-serving use of a principal's information to purchase or sell securities, in breach of a duty of loyalty and confidentiality, defrauds the principal of the exclusive use of the information. In lieu of premising liability on a fiduciary relationship between company insider and purchaser or seller of the company's stock, the misappropriation theory premises liability on a fiduciary-turned-trader's deception of those who entrusted him with access to confidential information.

The Court specifically recognized that a corporation's information is its property: "A company's confidential information&amp;nbsp;... qualifies as property to which the company has a right of exclusive use. The undisclosed misappropriation of such information in violation of a fiduciary duty&amp;nbsp;... constitutes fraud akin to embezzlement – the fraudulent appropriation to one's own use of the money or goods entrusted to one's care by another."

In 2000, the SEC enacted [[SEC Rule 10b5-1]], which defined trading "on the basis of" inside information as any time a person trades while aware of material nonpublic information. It is no longer a defense for one to say that one would have made the trade anyway. The rule also created an [[affirmative defense]] for pre-planned trades.

In ''[[Chip Skowron|Morgan Stanley v. Skowron]]'', 989 F. Supp. 2d 356 (S.D.N.Y. 2013), applying New York's [[faithless servant]] doctrine, the court held that a hedge fund's [[portfolio manager]] engaging in insider trading in violation of his company's code of conduct, which also required him to report his misconduct, must repay his employer the full $31&amp;nbsp;million his employer paid him as compensation during his period of faithlessness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3RaGDwAAQBAJ&amp;q=%22faithless+servant%22&amp;pg=PA472|title=Employment Law: Private Ordering and Its Limitations|first1=Timothy P.|last1=Glynn|first2=Rachel S.|last2=Arnow-Richman|first3=Charles A.|last3=Sullivan|date= 2019|publisher=Wolters Kluwer Law &amp; Business|via=Google Books|isbn=9781543801064}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/faithless-ex-morgan-stanley-fund-manager-ordered-repay-31m-former-employer-1429819|author=Jerin Matthew|title='Faithless' Ex-Morgan Stanley Fund Manager Ordered to Repay $31m to Former Employer|date=December 20, 2013|website=International Business Times UK|access-date=August 6, 2019|archive-date=July 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190706143933/https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/faithless-ex-morgan-stanley-fund-manager-ordered-repay-31m-former-employer-1429819|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/12/23/the-huge-costs-of-being-a-faithless-servant/|title=The Huge Costs of Being a 'Faithless Servant'|first=Peter J.|last=Henning|date=December 23, 2013|website=New York Times DealBook|access-date=August 6, 2019|archive-date=June 24, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190624175425/https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/12/23/the-huge-costs-of-being-a-faithless-servant/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Morgan-Stanley-seeks-10-2-million-from-convicted-4193127.php|title=Morgan Stanley seeks $10.2 million from convicted former trader|date=January 15, 2013|work=GreenwichTime|access-date=August 6, 2019|archive-date=June 27, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190627172218/https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Morgan-Stanley-seeks-10-2-million-from-convicted-4193127.php|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court called the insider trading the "ultimate abuse of a portfolio manager's position".&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; The judge also wrote: "In addition to exposing Morgan Stanley to government investigations and direct financial losses, Skowron's behavior damaged the firm's reputation, a valuable corporate asset."&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

In 2014, in the case of ''United States v. Newman'', the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit cited the Supreme Court's decision in ''Dirks'', and ruled that for a "tippee" (a person who used information they received from an insider) to be guilty of insider trading, the tippee must have been aware not only that the information was insider information, but must also have been aware that the insider released the information for an improper purpose (such as a personal benefit). The Court concluded that the insider's breach of a fiduciary duty not to release confidential information—in the absence of an improper purpose on the part of the insider—is not enough to impose criminal liability on either the insider or the tippee.&lt;ref name="United States v 2014"/&gt;

In 2016, in the case of ''[[Salman v. United States]]'', the U.S. Supreme Court held that the benefit a tipper must receive as predicate for an insider-trader prosecution of a tippee need not be pecuniary, and that giving a 'gift' of a tip to a family member is presumptively an act for the personal though intangible benefit of the tipper.&lt;ref name="Savage"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Savage |first=David G. |date=6 December 2016 |title=Supreme Court affirms broad reach of insider-trading laws |newspaper=The Los Angeles Times |url=https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-supreme-court-insider-trading-20161206-story.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161207135034/http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-supreme-court-insider-trading-20161206-story.html |archive-date=7 December 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, [[Billy Walters (gambler)|Billy Walters]], Las Vegas sports bettor, was convicted of making $40&amp;nbsp;million on private information of Dallas-based dairy processing company [[Dean Foods]], and sentenced to five years in prison. Walters's source, company director Thomas C. Davis employing a prepaid cell phone and sometimes the code words "Dallas Cowboys" for Dean Foods, helped him from 2008 to 2014 realize profits and avoid losses in the stock, the federal jury found. Golfer [[Phil Mickelson]] "was also mentioned during the trial as someone who had traded in Dean Foods shares and once owed nearly $2&amp;nbsp;million in gambling debts to" Walters. Mickelson "made roughly $1&amp;nbsp;million trading Dean Foods shares; he agreed to forfeit those profits in a related civil case brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission". Walters appealed the verdict, but in December 2018 his conviction was upheld by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;Moynihan, Colin, and Liz Moyer, [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/07/business/dealbook/william-t-walters-famed-sports-bettor-is-guilty-in-insider-trading-case.html "William T.

Populations can be diverse groups of people or objects such as "all people living in a country" or "every atom composing a crystal". Statistics deals with every aspect of data, including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of [[statistical survey|surveys]] and [[experimental design|experiments]].&lt;ref name="Dodge"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Dodge |first=Yadolah |title=The Oxford Dictionary of Statistical Terms |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2003 |isbn=0-19-920613-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[census]] data (comprising every member of the target population) cannot be collected, [[statistician]]s collect data by developing specific experiment designs and survey [[sample (statistics)|samples]]. Representative sampling assures that inferences and conclusions can reasonably extend from the sample to the population as a whole. An [[experimental study]] involves taking measurements of the system under study, manipulating the system, and then taking additional measurements using the same procedure to determine if the manipulation has modified the values of the measurements. In contrast, an [[observational study]] does not involve experimental manipulation.

Two main statistical methods are used in [[data analysis]]: [[descriptive statistics]], which summarize data from a sample using [[Index (statistics)|indexes]] such as the [[mean]] or [[standard deviation]], and [[statistical inference|inferential statistics]], which draw conclusions from data that are subject to random variation (e.g., observational errors, sampling variation).&lt;ref name=LundResearchLtd&gt;{{cite web |last=Lund Research Ltd. |url=https://statistics.laerd.com/statistical-guides/descriptive-inferential-statistics.php |title=Descriptive and Inferential Statistics |publisher=statistics.laerd.com |access-date=2014-03-23 |archive-date=2020-10-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201026075549/https://statistics.laerd.com/statistical-guides/descriptive-inferential-statistics.php |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Descriptive statistics are most often concerned with two sets of properties of a ''distribution'' (sample or population): ''[[central tendency]]'' (or ''location'') seeks to characterize the distribution's central or typical value, while ''[[statistical dispersion|dispersion]]'' (or ''variability'') characterizes the extent to which members of the distribution depart from its center and each other. Inferences made using [[mathematical statistics]] employ the framework of [[probability theory]], which deals with the analysis of random phenomena.

A standard statistical procedure involves the collection of data leading to a [[statistical hypothesis testing|test of the relationship]] between two statistical data sets, or a data set and synthetic data drawn from an idealized model. A hypothesis is proposed for the statistical relationship between the two data sets, an [[alternative hypothesis|alternative]] to an idealized [[null hypothesis]] of no relationship between two data sets. Rejecting or disproving the null hypothesis is done using statistical tests that quantify the sense in which the null can be proven false, given the data that are used in the test. Working from a null hypothesis, two basic forms of error are recognized: [[Type I error]]s (null hypothesis is rejected when it is in fact true, giving a "false positive") and [[Type II error]]s (null hypothesis fails to be rejected when it is in fact false, giving a "false negative"). Multiple problems have come to be associated with this framework, ranging from obtaining a sufficient sample size to specifying an adequate null hypothesis.&lt;ref name="LundResearchLtd" /&gt;

Statistical measurement processes are also prone to error in regards to the data that they generate. Many of these errors are classified as random (noise) or systematic ([[Bias (statistics)|bias]]), but other types of errors (e.g., blunder, such as when an analyst reports incorrect units) can also occur. The presence of [[missing data]] or [[censoring (statistics)|censoring]] may result in biased estimates and specific techniques have been developed to address these problems.

Statistics is considered the science of uncertainty. This arises from the ways to cope with measurement and sampling error as well as dealing with uncertanties in modelling. Although probability and statistics were once paired together as a single subject, they are conceptually distinct from one another. The former is based on deducing answers to specific situations from a general theory of probability, meanwhile statistics induces statements about a population based on a data set. Statistics serves to bridge the gap between probability and applied mathematical fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Williams |first=David |title=Weighing the Odds: A Course in Probability and Statistics |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2001 |isbn=9780521006187 |pages=xi-xvii |language=en |chapter=Preface}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hand20102" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Rudas |first=Tamas |title=International Encyclopedia of Statistical Science |publisher=Springer |year=2010 |isbn=978-3-642-04898-2 |editor-last=Lovric |editor-first=Miodrag |pages=1123–1126 |language=en |chapter=Probability Theory: An Outline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some consider statistics to be a distinct [[Mathematical sciences|mathematical science]] rather than a branch of mathematics.

The word statistics ultimately comes from the Latin word Status, meaning "situation" or "condition" in society, which in late Latin adopted the meaning "state". Derived from this, political scientist Gottfried Achenwall, coined the German word statistik (a summary of how things stand). In 1770, the term entered the English language through German and referred to the study of political arrangements. The term gained its modern meaning in the 1790s in John Sinclair's works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Sheynin |first=Oscar |title=International Encyclopedia of Statistical Science |publisher=Springer |year=2010 |isbn=978-3-642-04898-2 |editor-last=Lovric |editor-first=Miodrag |pages=1493–1504 |language=en |chapter=Statistics, History of}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= |first= |title=The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1996 |isbn=0-19-283098-8 |editor-last=Hoad |editor-first=T.

The term statistic, in singular form, is used to describe a function that returns its value of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Statistik |url=https://www.spektrum.de/lexikon/mathematik/statistik/9965 |access-date=2024-12-30 |website=www.spektrum.de |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistical data==
=== Data collection ===
====Sampling====
When full census data cannot be collected, statisticians collect sample data by developing specific [[design of experiments|experiment designs]] and [[survey sampling|survey samples]]. Statistics itself also provides tools for prediction and forecasting through [[statistical model]]s.

To use a sample as a guide to an entire population, it is important that it truly represents the overall population. Representative [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]] assures that inferences and conclusions can safely extend from the sample to the population as a whole. A major problem lies in determining the extent that the sample chosen is actually representative. Statistics offers methods to estimate and correct for any bias within the sample and data collection procedures. There are also methods of experimental design that can lessen these issues at the outset of a study, strengthening its capability to discern truths about the population.

Sampling theory is part of the [[mathematics|mathematical discipline]] of [[probability theory]]. Probability is used in [[statistical theory|mathematical statistics]] to study the [[sampling distribution]]s of [[sample statistic]]s and, more generally, the properties of [[statistical decision theory|statistical procedures]]. The use of any statistical method is valid when the system or population under consideration satisfies the assumptions of the method. The difference in point of view between classic probability theory and sampling theory is, roughly, that probability theory starts from the given parameters of a total population to [[deductive reasoning|deduce]] probabilities that pertain to samples. Statistical inference, however, moves in the opposite direction—[[inductive reasoning|inductively inferring]] from samples to the parameters of a larger or total population.

====Experimental and observational studies====
A common goal for a statistical research project is to investigate [[causality]], and in particular to draw a conclusion on the effect of changes in the values of predictors or [[Dependent and independent variables|independent variables on dependent variables]]. There are two major types of causal statistical studies: [[Experiment|experimental studies]] and [[Observational study|observational studies]]. In both types of studies, the effect of differences of an independent variable (or variables) on the behavior of the dependent variable are observed. The difference between the two types lies in how the study is actually conducted. Each can be very effective. An experimental study involves taking measurements of the system under study, manipulating the system, and then taking additional [[Level of measurement|measurements with different levels]] using the same procedure to determine if the manipulation has modified the values of the measurements. In contrast, an observational study does not involve [[Scientific control|experimental manipulation]]. Instead, data are gathered and correlations between predictors and response are investigated. While the tools of data analysis work best on data from [[Randomized controlled trial|randomized studies]], they are also applied to other kinds of data—like [[natural experiment]]s and [[Observational study|observational studies]]&lt;ref&gt;[[David A. Freedman (statistician)|Freedman, D.A.]] (2005) ''Statistical Models: Theory and Practice'', Cambridge University Press. {{isbn|978-0-521-67105-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;—for which a statistician would use a modified, more structured estimation method (e.g., [[Difference in differences|difference in differences estimation]] and [[instrumental variable]]s, among many others) that produce [[consistent estimator]]s.

=====Experiments=====
The basic steps of a statistical experiment are:

# Planning the research, including finding the number of replicates of the study, using the following information:  preliminary estimates regarding the size of [[Average treatment effect|treatment effects]], [[alternative hypothesis|alternative hypotheses]], and the estimated [[experimental error|experimental variability]]. Consideration of the selection of experimental subjects and the ethics of research is necessary. Statisticians recommend that experiments compare (at least) one new treatment with a standard treatment or control, to allow an unbiased estimate of the difference in treatment effects.
# [[Design of experiments]], using [[blocking (statistics)|blocking]] to reduce the influence of [[confounding variable]]s, and [[randomized assignment]] of treatments to subjects to allow [[bias of an estimator|unbiased estimates]] of treatment effects and experimental error. At this stage, the experimenters and statisticians write the ''[[protocol (natural sciences)|experimental protocol]]'' that will guide the performance of the experiment and which specifies the'' primary analysis'' of the experimental data.
# Performing the experiment following the [[Protocol (natural sciences)|experimental protocol]] and [[analysis of variance|analyzing the data]] following the experimental protocol.
# Further examining the data set in secondary analyses, to suggest new hypotheses for future study.
# Documenting and presenting the results of the study.

Experiments on human behavior have special concerns. The famous [[Hawthorne study]] examined changes to the working environment at the Hawthorne plant of the [[Western Electric Company]]. The researchers were interested in determining whether increased illumination would increase the productivity of the [[assembly line]] workers. The researchers first measured the productivity in the plant, then modified the illumination in an area of the plant and checked if the changes in illumination affected productivity. It turned out that productivity indeed improved (under the experimental conditions). However, the study is heavily criticized today for errors in experimental procedures, specifically for the lack of a [[control group]] and [[double-blind|blindness]]. The [[Hawthorne effect]] refers to finding that an outcome (in this case, worker productivity) changed due to observation itself. Those in the Hawthorne study became more productive not because the lighting was changed but because they were being observed.&lt;ref name="pmid17608932"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McCarney R, Warner J, Iliffe S, van Haselen R, Griffin M, Fisher P |title=The Hawthorne Effect: a randomised, controlled trial |journal=BMC Med Res Methodol |volume=7|pages=30 |year=2007 |pmid=17608932 |pmc=1936999 |doi=10.1186/1471-2288-7-30 |issue=1 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Observational study=====
An example of an observational study is one that explores the association between smoking and lung cancer. This type of study typically uses a survey to collect observations about the area of interest and then performs statistical analysis. In this case, the researchers would collect observations of both smokers and non-smokers, perhaps through a [[cohort study]], and then look for the number of cases of lung cancer in each group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Rothman|editor1-first=Kenneth J|editor2-last=Greenland|editor2-first=Sander|editor3-last=Lash|editor3-first=Timothy|title=Modern Epidemiology|url=https://archive.org/details/modernepidemiolo00roth|url-access=limited|date=2008|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|page=[https://archive.org/details/modernepidemiolo00roth/page/n100 100]|edition=3rd|language=en|chapter=7|isbn=978-0781755641}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[case-control study]] is another type of observational study in which people with and without the outcome of interest (e.g. lung cancer) are invited to participate and their exposure histories are collected.

===Types of data===
{{main|Statistical data type||Levels of measurement}}

Various attempts have been made to produce a taxonomy of [[level of measurement|levels of measurement]]. The psychophysicist [[Stanley Smith Stevens]] defined nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio scales. Nominal measurements do not have meaningful rank order among values, and permit any one-to-one (injective) transformation. Ordinal measurements have imprecise differences between consecutive values, but have a meaningful order to those values, and permit any order-preserving transformation. Interval measurements have meaningful distances between measurements defined, but the zero value is arbitrary (as in the case with [[longitude]] and [[temperature]] measurements in [[Celsius]] or [[Fahrenheit]]), and permit any linear transformation. Ratio measurements have both a meaningful zero value and the distances between different measurements defined, and permit any rescaling transformation.

Because variables conforming only to nominal or ordinal measurements cannot be reasonably measured numerically, sometimes they are grouped together as [[categorical variable]]s, whereas ratio and interval measurements are grouped together as [[Variable (mathematics)#Applied statistics|quantitative variables]], which can be either [[Probability distribution#Discrete probability distribution|discrete]] or [[Probability distribution#Continuous probability distribution|continuous]], due to their numerical nature. Such distinctions can often be loosely correlated with [[data type]] in computer science, in that dichotomous categorical variables may be represented with the [[Boolean data type]], polytomous categorical variables with arbitrarily assigned [[integer]]s in the [[integer (computer science)|integral data type]], and continuous variables with the [[real data type]] involving [[floating-point arithmetic]]. But the mapping of computer science data types to statistical data types depends on which categorization of the latter is being implemented.

Other categorizations have been proposed. For example, Mosteller and Tukey (1977)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Mosteller | first1 = F. | author-link1 = Frederick Mosteller | last2 = Tukey | first2 = J.W | author-link2 = John Tukey | year = 1977 | title = Data analysis and regression | location = Boston | publisher = Addison-Wesley}}&lt;/ref&gt; distinguished grades, ranks, counted fractions, counts, amounts, and balances. Nelder (1990)&lt;ref&gt;[[John Nelder|Nelder, J.A.]] (1990). The knowledge needed to computerise the analysis and interpretation of statistical information. In ''Expert systems and artificial intelligence: the need for information about data''. Library Association Report, London, March, 23–27.&lt;/ref&gt; described continuous counts, continuous ratios, count ratios, and categorical modes of data. (See also: Chrisman (1998),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chrisman | first1 = Nicholas R | year = 1998 | title = Rethinking Levels of Measurement for Cartography | journal = Cartography and Geographic Information Science | volume = 25 | issue = 4| pages = 231–242 | doi=10.1559/152304098782383043| bibcode = 1998CGISy..25..231C }}&lt;/ref&gt; van den Berg (1991).&lt;ref&gt;van den Berg, G. (1991). ''Choosing an analysis method''. Leiden: DSWO Press&lt;/ref&gt;)

The issue of whether or not it is appropriate to apply different kinds of statistical methods to data obtained from different kinds of measurement procedures is complicated by issues concerning the transformation of variables and the precise interpretation of research questions. "The relationship between the data and what they describe merely reflects the fact that certain kinds of statistical statements may have truth values which are not invariant under some transformations. Whether or not a transformation is sensible to contemplate depends on the question one is trying to answer."&lt;ref&gt;Hand, D.J. (2004).

=== Descriptive statistics ===
{{main|Descriptive statistics}}

A '''descriptive statistic''' (in the [[count noun]] sense) is a [[summary statistic]] that quantitatively describes or summarizes features of a collection of [[information]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mann |first=Prem S. |year=1995 |title=Introductory Statistics |url=https://archive.org/details/introductorystat02edmann_z9s5 |url-access=registration |edition=2nd |publisher=Wiley |isbn=0-471-31009-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while '''descriptive statistics''' in the [[mass noun]] sense is the process of using and analyzing those statistics. Descriptive statistics is distinguished from [[statistical inference|inferential statistics]] (or inductive statistics), in that descriptive statistics aims to summarize a [[Sample (statistics)|sample]], rather than use the data to learn about the [[statistical population|population]] that the sample of data is thought to represent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Descriptive Statistics {{!}} Research Connections |url=https://www.researchconnections.org/research-tools/descriptive-statistics |access-date=2023-01-10 |website=www.researchconnections.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inferential statistics ===
{{main|Statistical inference}}

'''Statistical inference''' is the process of using [[data analysis]] to deduce properties of an underlying [[probability distribution]].&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;Upton, G., Cook, I. (2008) ''Oxford Dictionary of Statistics'', OUP. {{ISBN|978-0-19-954145-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Inferential statistical analysis infers properties of a [[Statistical population|population]], for example by testing hypotheses and deriving estimates.  It is assumed that the observed data set is [[Sampling (statistics)|sampled]] from a larger population. Inferential statistics can be contrasted with [[descriptive statistics]]. Descriptive statistics is solely concerned with properties of the observed data, and it does not rest on the assumption that the data come from a larger population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Basic Inferential Statistics - Purdue OWL - Purdue University |url=https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/using_research/writing_with_statistics/basic_inferential_statistics.html |access-date=2023-01-10 |website=owl.purdue.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Terminology and theory of inferential statistics====
=====Statistics, estimators and pivotal quantities=====
Consider [[Independent identically distributed|independent identically distributed (IID) random variables]] with a given [[probability distribution]]: standard [[statistical inference]] and [[estimation theory]] defines a [[random sample]] as the [[random vector]] given by the [[column vector]] of these IID variables.&lt;ref name="Piazza"&gt;Piazza Elio, Probabilità e Statistica, Esculapio 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Statistical population|population]] being examined is described by a probability distribution that may have unknown parameters.

A statistic is a random variable that is a function of the random sample, but {{em|not a function of unknown parameters}}. The probability distribution of the statistic, though, may have unknown parameters. Consider now a function of the unknown parameter: an [[estimator]] is a statistic used to estimate such function. Commonly used estimators include [[sample mean]], unbiased [[sample variance]] and [[sample covariance]].

A random variable that is a function of the random sample and of the unknown parameter, but whose probability distribution ''does not depend on the unknown parameter'' is called a [[pivotal quantity]] or pivot. Widely used pivots include the [[z-score]], the [[Chi-squared distribution#Applications|chi square statistic]] and Student's [[Student's t-distribution#How the t-distribution arises|t-value]].

Between two estimators of a given parameter, the one with lower [[mean squared error]] is said to be more [[Efficient estimator|efficient]]. Furthermore, an estimator is said to be [[Unbiased estimator|unbiased]] if its [[expected value]] is equal to the [[true value]] of the unknown parameter being estimated, and asymptotically unbiased if its expected value converges at the [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]] to the true value of such parameter.

Other desirable properties for estimators include: [[UMVUE]] estimators that have the lowest variance for all possible values of the parameter to be estimated (this is usually an easier property to verify than efficiency) and [[consistent estimator]]s which [[converges in probability]] to the true value of such parameter.

This still leaves the question of how to obtain estimators in a given situation and carry the computation, several methods have been proposed: the [[method of moments (statistics)|method of moments]], the [[maximum likelihood]] method, the [[least squares]] method and the more recent method of [[estimating equations]].

=====Null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis=====
Interpretation of statistical information can often involve the development of a [[null hypothesis]] which is usually (but not necessarily) that no relationship exists among variables or that no change occurred over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Everitt | first = Brian | title = The Cambridge Dictionary of Statistics | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK New York | year = 1998 | isbn = 0521593468 | url = https://archive.org/details/cambridgediction00ever_0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yourstatsguru.com/epar/rp-reviewed/cohen1994/ |title=Cohen (1994) The Earth Is Round (p &lt; .05) |publisher=YourStatsGuru.com |access-date=2015-07-20 |archive-date=2015-09-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905081658/http://www.yourstatsguru.com/epar/rp-reviewed/cohen1994/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[alternative hypothesis]] is the name of the hypothesis that contradicts the null hypothesis.

The best illustration for a novice is the predicament encountered by a [[criminal trial]]. The null hypothesis, H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, asserts that the defendant is innocent, whereas the alternative hypothesis, H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, asserts that the defendant is [[Guilt (law)|guilty]]. The [[indictment]] comes because of suspicion of the guilt. The H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (the [[status quo]]) stands in opposition to H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and is maintained unless H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is supported by evidence "beyond a reasonable doubt". However, "failure to reject H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;" in this case does not imply innocence, but merely that the evidence was insufficient to convict. So the jury does not necessarily &lt;em&gt;accept&lt;/em&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; but &lt;em&gt;fails to reject&lt;/em&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. While one can not "prove" a null hypothesis, one can test how close it is to being true with a [[Statistical power|power test]], which tests for [[type II error]]s.

=====Error=====
Working from a [[null hypothesis]], two broad categories of error are recognized:

* [[Type I and type II errors#Type I error|Type I errors]] where the null hypothesis is falsely rejected, giving a "false positive".
* [[Type I and type II errors#Type II error|Type II errors]] where the null hypothesis fails to be rejected and an actual difference between populations is missed, giving a "false negative".

[[Standard deviation]] refers to the extent to which individual observations in a sample differ from a central value, such as the sample or population mean, while [[Standard error (statistics)#Standard error of the mean|Standard error]] refers to an estimate of difference between sample mean and population mean.

A [[Errors and residuals in statistics#Introduction|statistical error]] is the amount by which an observation differs from its [[expected value]]. A [[Errors and residuals in statistics#Introduction|residual]] is the amount an observation differs from the value the estimator of the expected value assumes on a given sample (also called prediction).

[[Mean squared error]] is used for obtaining [[efficient estimators]], a widely used class of estimators. [[Root mean square error]] is simply the square root of mean squared error.

[[File:Linear least squares(2).svg|thumb|right|A least squares fit: in red the points to be fitted, in blue the fitted line.]]

Many statistical methods seek to minimize the [[residual sum of squares]], and these are called "[[least squares|methods of least squares]]" in contrast to [[Least absolute deviations]]. The latter gives equal weight to small and big errors, while the former gives more weight to large errors. Residual sum of squares is also [[Differentiable function|differentiable]], which provides a handy property for doing [[regression analysis|regression]]. Least squares applied to [[linear regression]] is called [[ordinary least squares]] method and least squares applied to [[nonlinear regression]] is called [[non-linear least squares]]. Also in a linear regression model the non deterministic part of the model is called error term, disturbance or more simply noise. Both linear regression and non-linear regression are addressed in [[polynomial least squares]], which also describes the variance in a prediction of the dependent variable (y axis) as a function of the independent variable (x axis) and the deviations (errors, noise, disturbances) from the estimated (fitted) curve.

Measurement processes that generate statistical data are also subject to error.  Many of these errors are classified as [[Random error|random]] (noise) or [[Systematic error|systematic]] ([[bias]]), but other types of errors (e.g., blunder, such as when an analyst reports incorrect units) can also be important. The presence of [[missing data]] or [[censoring (statistics)|censoring]] may result in [[bias (statistics)|biased estimates]] and specific techniques have been developed to address these problems.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, Donald B.; Little, Roderick J.A., Statistical analysis with missing data, New York: Wiley 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Interval estimation=====
{{main|Interval estimation}}

[[File:NYW-confidence-interval.svg|thumb|right|[[Confidence intervals]]: the red line is true value for the mean in this example, the blue lines are random confidence intervals for 100 realizations.]]

Most studies only sample part of a population, so results do not fully represent the whole population. Any estimates obtained from the sample only approximate the population value. [[Confidence intervals]] allow statisticians to express how closely the sample estimate matches the true value in the whole population. Often they are expressed as 95% confidence intervals. Formally, a 95% confidence interval for a value is a range where, if the sampling and analysis were repeated under the same conditions (yielding a different dataset), the interval would include the true (population) value in 95% of all possible cases. This does ''not'' imply that the probability that the true value is in the confidence interval is 95%. From the [[frequentist inference|frequentist]] perspective, such a claim does not even make sense, as the true value is not a [[random variable]].  Either the true value is or is not within the given interval. However, it is true that, before any data are sampled and given a plan for how to construct the confidence interval, the probability is 95% that the yet-to-be-calculated interval will cover the true value: at this point, the limits of the interval are yet-to-be-observed [[random variable]]s. One approach that does yield an interval that can be interpreted as having a given probability of containing the true value is to use a [[credible interval]] from [[Bayesian statistics]]: this approach depends on a different way of [[Probability interpretations|interpreting what is meant by "probability"]], that is as a [[Bayesian probability]].

In principle confidence intervals can be symmetrical or asymmetrical. An interval can be asymmetrical because it works as lower or upper bound for a parameter (left-sided interval or right sided interval), but it can also be asymmetrical because the two sided interval is built violating symmetry around the estimate. Sometimes the bounds for a confidence interval are reached asymptotically and these are used to approximate the true bounds.

=====Significance=====
{{main|Statistical significance}}

Statistics rarely give a simple Yes/No type answer to the question under analysis. Interpretation often comes down to the level of statistical significance applied to the numbers and often refers to the probability of a value accurately rejecting the null hypothesis (sometimes referred to as the [[p-value]]).

[[File:P-value in statistical significance testing.svg|upright=1.8|thumb|right|In this graph the black line is probability distribution for the [[test statistic]], the [[Critical region#Definition of terms|critical region]] is the set of values to the right of the observed data point (observed value of the test statistic) and the [[p-value]] is represented by the green area.]]

The standard approach&lt;ref name="Piazza" /&gt; is to test a null hypothesis against an alternative hypothesis. A [[Critical region#Definition of terms|critical region]] is the set of values of the estimator that leads to refuting the null hypothesis. The probability of type I error is therefore the probability that the estimator belongs to the critical region given that null hypothesis is true ([[statistical significance]]) and the probability of type II error is the probability that the estimator does not belong to the critical region given that the alternative hypothesis is true. The [[statistical power]] of a test is the probability that it correctly rejects the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is false.

Referring to statistical significance does not necessarily mean that the overall result is significant in real world terms. For example, in a large study of a drug it may be shown that the drug has a statistically significant but very small beneficial effect, such that the drug is unlikely to help the patient noticeably.

Although in principle the acceptable level of statistical significance may be subject to debate, the [[significance level]] is the largest p-value that allows the test to reject the null hypothesis. This test is logically equivalent to saying that the p-value is the probability, assuming the null hypothesis is true, of observing a result at least as extreme as the [[test statistic]]. Therefore, the smaller the significance level, the lower the probability of committing type I error.

Some problems are usually associated with this framework (See [[Statistical hypothesis testing#Criticism|criticism of hypothesis testing]]):

* A difference that is highly statistically significant can still be of no practical significance, but it is possible to properly formulate tests to account for this. One response involves going beyond reporting only the [[significance level]] to include the [[p-value|''p''-value]] when reporting whether a hypothesis is rejected or accepted. The p-value, however, does not indicate the [[effect size|size]] or importance of the observed effect and can also seem to exaggerate the importance of minor differences in large studies. A better and increasingly common approach is to report [[confidence interval]]s. Although these are produced from the same calculations as those of hypothesis tests or ''p''-values, they describe both the size of the effect and the uncertainty surrounding it.
* Fallacy of the transposed conditional, aka [[prosecutor's fallacy]]: criticisms arise because the hypothesis testing approach forces one hypothesis (the [[null hypothesis]]) to be favored, since what is being evaluated is the probability of the observed result given the null hypothesis and not probability of the null hypothesis given the observed result. An alternative to this approach is offered by [[Bayesian inference]], although it requires establishing a [[prior probability]].&lt;ref name="Ioannidis2005"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ioannidis | first1 = J.P.A. | author-link1 = John P.A.

=== Bayesian Statistics ===
{{main|Bayesian Statistics}}
An alternative paradigm to the popular [[frequentist inference|frequentist]] paradigm is to use [[Bayes' theorem]] to update the [[prior probability]] of the hypotheses in consideration based on the [[likelihood function|relative likelihood]] of the evidence gathered to obtain a [[posterior probability]]. Bayesian methods have been aided by the increase in available computing power to compute the [[posterior probability]] using numerical approximation techniques like [[Markov Chain Monte Carlo]]. 

For statistically modelling purposes, Bayesian models tend to be [[Bayesian hierarchical modeling|hierarchical]], for example, one could model each [[Youtube]] channel as having video views distributed as a normal distribution with channel dependent mean and variance &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{N}(\mu_i, \sigma_i) &lt;/math&gt;, while modeling the channel means as themselves coming from a normal distribution representing the distribution of average video view counts per channel, and the variances as coming from another distribution. 

The concept of using [[likelihood_function#Likelihood_ratio|likelihood ratio]] can also be prominently seen in [[likelihood ratios in diagnostic testing|medical diagnostic testing]].

===Exploratory data analysis===
{{main|Exploratory data analysis}}

'''Exploratory data analysis''' ('''EDA''') is an approach to [[data analysis|analyzing]] [[data set]]s to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. A [[statistical model]] can be used or not, but primarily EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task.

=== Mathematical statistics ===
{{main|Mathematical statistics}}
Mathematical statistics is the application of mathematics to statistics. Mathematical techniques used for this include [[mathematical analysis]], [[linear algebra]], [[stochastic analysis]], [[differential equations]], and [[measure-theoretic probability theory]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; All statistical analyses make use of at least some mathematics, and mathematical statistics can therefore be regarded as a fundamental component of general statistics.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== History ==
{{main|History of statistics|Founders of statistics}}
[[File:Jakob Bernoulli.jpg|thumb|Bernoulli's ''{{langr|la|[[Ars Conjectandi]]}}'' was the first work that dealt with [[probability theory]] as currently understood.]]

Formal discussions on inference date back to the [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|mathematicians]] and [[cryptographers]] of the [[Islamic Golden Age]] between the 8th and 13th centuries. [[Al-Khalil ibn Ahmad al-Farahidi|Al-Khalil]] (717–786) wrote the ''Book of Cryptographic Messages'', which contains one of the first uses of [[permutation]]s and [[combination]]s, to list all possible Arabic words with and without vowels.&lt;ref name="LB"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Broemeling |first=Lyle D. |date=1 November 2011 |title=An Account of Early Statistical Inference in Arab Cryptology |journal=The American Statistician |volume=65 |issue=4 |pages=255–257 |doi=10.1198/tas.2011.10191 |s2cid=123537702}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al-Kindi]]'s ''Manuscript on Deciphering Cryptographic Messages'' gave a detailed description of how to use [[frequency analysis]] to decipher [[encrypted]] messages, providing an early example of [[statistical inference]] for [[Code|decoding]]. [[Ibn Adlan]] (1187–1268) later made an important contribution on the use of [[sample size]] in frequency analysis.&lt;ref name="LB" /&gt;

Although the term ''statistic'' was introduced by the Italian scholar [[Girolamo Ghilini]] in 1589 with reference to a collection of facts and information about a state, it was the German [[Gottfried Achenwall]] in 1749 who started using the term as a collection of quantitative information, in the modern use for this science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ostasiewicz |first=Walenty |year=2014 |title=The emergence of statistical science |journal=Śląski Przegląd Statystyczny |volume=12 |issue=18 |pages=76–77 |doi=10.15611/sps.2014.12.04 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Bruneau |first=Quentin |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=63RnEAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT64 |title=States and the Masters of Capital: Sovereign Lending, Old and New |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |year=2022 |isbn=978-0231555647}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest writing containing statistics in Europe dates back to 1663, with the publication of ''[[Natural and Political Observations upon the Bills of Mortality]]'' by [[John Graunt]].&lt;ref&gt;Willcox, Walter (1938) "The Founder of Statistics". ''Review of the [[International Statistical Institute]]'' 5(4): 321–328. {{JSTOR|1400906}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early applications of statistical thinking revolved around the needs of states to base policy on demographic and economic data, hence its [[History of statistics#Etymology|''stat-'' etymology]]. The scope of the discipline of statistics broadened in the early 19th century to include the collection and analysis of data in general. Today, statistics is widely employed in government, business, and natural and social sciences.

[[File:Carl Friedrich Gauss 1840 by Jensen.jpg|thumb|left|[[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] made major contributions to probabilistic methods leading to statistics.]]

The mathematical foundations of statistics developed from discussions concerning [[Game of chance|games of chance]] among mathematicians such as [[Gerolamo Cardano]], [[Blaise Pascal]], [[Pierre de Fermat]], and [[Christiaan Huygens]]. Although the idea of probability was already examined in ancient and medieval law and philosophy (such as the work of [[Juan Caramuel]]), [[probability theory]] as a mathematical discipline only took shape at the very end of the 17th century, particularly in [[Jacob Bernoulli]]'s posthumous work ''{{langr|la|[[Ars Conjectandi]]}}''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Franklin |first=James |title=The Science of Conjecture |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-8018-7109-2 |location=Baltimore}}

The second wave of the 1910s and 20s was initiated by [[William Sealy Gosset]], and reached its culmination in the insights of [[Ronald Fisher]], who wrote the textbooks that were to define the academic discipline in universities around the world. Fisher's most important publications were his 1918 seminal paper ''[[The Correlation between Relatives on the Supposition of Mendelian Inheritance]]'' (which was the first to use the statistical term, [[variance]]), his classic 1925 work ''[[Statistical Methods for Research Workers]]'' and his 1935 ''[[The Design of Experiments]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Box |first=J.

The final wave, which mainly saw the refinement and expansion of earlier developments, emerged from the collaborative work between [[Egon Pearson]] and [[Jerzy Neyman]] in the 1930s. They introduced the concepts of "[[Type I and type II errors|Type II]]" error, [[power of a test]] and [[confidence interval]]s. Jerzy Neyman in 1934 showed that stratified random sampling was in general a better method of estimation than purposive (quota) sampling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Neyman |first1=J. |year=1934 |title=On the two different aspects of the representative method: The method of stratified sampling and the method of purposive selection |journal=[[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society]] |volume=97 |issue=4 |pages=557–625 |doi=10.2307/2342192 |jstor=2342192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the early attempts to measure national economic activity were those of [[William Petty]] in the 17th century. In the 20th century the uniform [[System of National Accounts]] was developed&lt;ref&gt;[https://sk.sagepub.com/ency/edvol/businesstoday/chpt/national-accounts National Accounts]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Today, statistical methods are applied in all fields that involve decision making, for making accurate inferences from a collated body of data and for making decisions in the face of uncertainty based on statistical methodology. The use of modern [[computer]]s has expedited large-scale statistical computations and has also made possible new methods that are impractical to perform manually. Statistics continues to be an area of active research, for example on the problem of how to analyze [[big data]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2 December 2013 |title=Science in a Complex World – Big Data: Opportunity or Threat? |url=http://www.santafe.edu/news/item/sfnm-wood-big-data/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530001750/http://www.santafe.edu/news/item/sfnm-wood-big-data/ |archive-date=2016-05-30 |access-date=2014-10-13 |work=Santa Fe Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statistical computing===
{{Main|Computational statistics}}
[[File:Gretl screenshot.png|thumb|upright=1.15|right|[[gretl]], an example of an [[List of open source statistical packages|open source statistical package]]]]

The rapid and sustained increases in computing power starting from the second half of the 20th century have had a substantial impact on the practice of statistical science. Early statistical models were almost always from the class of [[linear model]]s, but powerful computers, coupled with suitable numerical [[algorithms]], caused an increased interest in [[Nonlinear regression|nonlinear models]] (such as [[Artificial neural network|neural networks]]) as well as the creation of new types, such as [[generalized linear model]]s and [[multilevel model]]s.

Increased computing power has also led to the growing popularity of computationally intensive methods based on [[Resampling (statistics)|resampling]], such as [[permutation test]]s and the [[Bootstrapping (statistics)|bootstrap]], while techniques such as [[Gibbs sampling]] have made use of [[Bayesian model]]s more feasible. The computer revolution has implications for the future of statistics with a new emphasis on "experimental" and "empirical" statistics. A large number of both general and special purpose [[List of statistical packages|statistical software]] are now available. Examples of available software capable of complex statistical computation include programs such as [[Mathematica]], [[SAS (software)|SAS]], [[SPSS]], and [[R (programming language)|R]].

Statistical techniques are used in a wide range of types of scientific and social research, including: [[biostatistics]], [[computational biology]], [[computational sociology]], [[network biology]], [[social science]], [[sociology]] and [[social research]]. Some fields of inquiry use applied statistics so extensively that they have [[specialized terminology]]. These disciplines include:

{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|* [[Actuarial science]] (assesses risk in the insurance and finance industries)
* Applied information economics
* [[Astrostatistics]] (statistical evaluation of astronomical data)
* [[Biostatistics]]
* [[Chemometrics]] (for analysis of data from [[chemistry]])
* [[Data mining]] (applying statistics and [[pattern recognition]] to discover knowledge from data)
* [[Data science]]
* [[Demography]] (statistical study of populations)
* [[Econometrics]] (statistical analysis of economic data)
* [[Statistical study of energy data|Energy statistics]]
* [[Engineering statistics]]
* [[Epidemiology]] (statistical analysis of disease)
* [[Geography]] and [[geographic information system]]s, specifically in [[spatial analysis]]
* [[Image processing]]
* [[Jurimetrics]] ([[law]])
* [[Medical statistics]]
* [[Political science]]
* [[Psychological statistics]]
* [[Reliability engineering]]
* [[Social statistics]]
* [[Statistical mechanics]]}}

In addition, there are particular types of statistical analysis that have also developed their own specialised terminology and methodology:

{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|
* [[Bootstrapping (statistics)|Bootstrap]]{{\}}[[jackknife resampling]]
* [[Multivariate statistics]]
* [[Statistical classification]]
* [[Structured data analysis (statistics)|Structured data analysis]]
* [[Structural equation modelling]]
* [[Survey methodology]]
* [[Survival analysis]]
* Statistics in various sports, particularly [[Baseball statistics|baseball]] – known as [[sabermetrics]] – and [[Cricket statistics|cricket]]
}}

Statistics form a key basis tool in business and manufacturing as well. It is used to understand measurement systems variability, control processes (as in [[statistical process control]] or SPC), for summarizing data, and to make data-driven decisions.

== Misuse ==
{{main|Misuse of statistics}}

[[Misuse of statistics]] can produce subtle but serious errors in description and interpretation—subtle in the sense that even experienced professionals make such errors, and serious in the sense that they can lead to devastating decision errors. For instance, social policy, medical practice, and the reliability of structures like bridges all rely on the proper use of statistics.

Even when statistical techniques are correctly applied, the results can be difficult to interpret for those lacking expertise. The [[statistical significance]] of a trend in the data—which measures the extent to which a trend could be caused by random variation in the sample—may or may not agree with an intuitive sense of its significance. The set of basic statistical skills (and skepticism) that people need to deal with information in their everyday lives properly is referred to as [[statistical literacy]].

There is a general perception that statistical knowledge is all-too-frequently intentionally [[Misuse of statistics|misused]] by finding ways to interpret only the data that are favorable to the presenter.&lt;ref name="Huff"&gt;Huff, Darrell (1954) ''[[How to Lie with Statistics]]'',  WW Norton &amp; Company, Inc. New York.  {{isbn|0-393-31072-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A mistrust and misunderstanding of statistics is associated with the quotation, "[[Lies, damned lies, and statistics|There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics]]". Misuse of statistics can be both inadvertent and intentional, and the book ''[[How to Lie with Statistics]]'',&lt;ref name="Huff" /&gt; by [[Darrell Huff]], outlines a range of considerations. In an attempt to shed light on the use and misuse of statistics, reviews of statistical techniques used in particular fields are conducted (e.g. Warne, Lazo, Ramos, and Ritter (2012)).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Warne |first1=R. Lazo |last2=Ramos |first2=T. |last3=Ritter |first3=N. |year=2012 |title=Statistical Methods Used in Gifted Education Journals, 2006–2010 |journal=Gifted Child Quarterly |volume=56 |issue=3 |pages=134–149 |doi=10.1177/0016986212444122 |s2cid=144168910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ways to avoid misuse of statistics include using proper diagrams and avoiding [[Bias (statistics)|bias]].&lt;ref name="Statistics in Archaeology"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Drennan |first1=Robert D. |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaarch00pear |title=Encyclopedia of Archaeology |publisher=Elsevier Inc. |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-12-373962-9 |editor-last=Pearsall |editor-first=Deborah M. |pages=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaarch00pear/page/n2072 2093]–2100 |chapter=Statistics in archaeology |url-access=limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; Misuse can occur when conclusions are [[Hasty generalization|overgeneralized]] and claimed to be representative of more than they really are, often by either deliberately or unconsciously overlooking sampling bias.&lt;ref name="Misuse of Statistics"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cohen |first=Jerome B. |date=December 1938 |title=Misuse of Statistics |journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association |location=JSTOR |volume=33 |issue=204 |pages=657–674 |doi=10.1080/01621459.1938.10502344}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bar graphs are arguably the easiest diagrams to use and understand, and they can be made either by hand or with simple computer programs.&lt;ref name="Statistics in Archaeology" /&gt; Most people do not look for bias or errors, so they are not noticed. Thus, people may often believe that something is true even if it is not well [[Sampling (statistics)|represented]].&lt;ref name="Misuse of Statistics" /&gt; To make data gathered from statistics believable and accurate, the sample taken must be representative of the whole.&lt;ref name="Modern Elementary Statistics"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Freund |first=J.E. |author-link=John E. Freund |year=1988 |title=Modern Elementary Statistics |journal=Credo Reference}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Huff, "The dependability of a sample can be destroyed by [bias]... allow yourself some degree of skepticism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Huff |first=Darrell |title=How to Lie with Statistics |author2=Irving Geis |publisher=Norton |year=1954 |location=New York |quote=The dependability of a sample can be destroyed by [bias]... allow yourself some degree of skepticism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To assist in the understanding of statistics Huff proposed a series of questions to be asked in each case:&lt;ref name="Huff" /&gt;

* Who says so? (Does he/she have an axe to grind?)
* How does he/she know? (Does he/she have the resources to know the facts?)
* What's missing? (Does he/she give us a complete picture?)
* Did someone change the subject? (Does he/she offer us the right answer to the wrong problem?)
* Does it make sense? (Is his/her conclusion logical and consistent with what we already know?)

===Misinterpretation: correlation===
{{See also|Correlation does not imply causation}}
[[File:Simple Confounding Case.svg|upright=0.9|thumb|right|The [[confounding variable]] problem: ''X'' and ''Y'' may be correlated, not because there is causal relationship between them, but because both depend on a third variable ''Z''. ''Z'' is called a confounding factor.]]

The concept of [[correlation]] is particularly noteworthy for the potential confusion it can cause. Statistical analysis of a [[data set]] often reveals that two variables (properties) of the population under consideration tend to vary together, as if they were connected. For example, a study of annual income that also looks at age of death, might find that poor people tend to have shorter lives than affluent people. The two variables are said to be correlated; however, they may or may not be the cause of one another. The correlation phenomena could be caused by a third, previously unconsidered phenomenon, called a lurking variable or [[confounding variable]]. For this reason, there is no way to immediately infer the existence of a causal relationship between the two variables.

A '''fallacy''' is the use of [[Validity (logic)|invalid]] or otherwise faulty [[reason]]ing in the construction of an [[argument]]&lt;ref name="GenslerAZ"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Gensler |first=Harry J. |title=The A to Z of Logic |date=2010 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |isbn=978-0810875968 |page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Woods |first=John |title=The Death of Argument |date=2004 |isbn=978-9048167005 |series=Applied Logic Series |volume=32 |pages=3–23 |chapter=Who Cares About the Fallacies? |doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-2712-3_1 |author-link=John Woods (logician)}}&lt;/ref&gt; that may appear to be well-reasoned if unnoticed. The term was introduced in the Western intellectual tradition by the [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] ''[[Sophistical Refutations|De Sophisticis Elenchis]]''.&lt;ref name="Downden" /&gt; 

Fallacies may be committed intentionally to [[Psychological manipulation|manipulate]] or [[Persuasion|persuade]] by [[deception]], unintentionally because of human limitations such as [[carelessness]], [[Biases in judgment and decision making|cognitive or social biases]] and [[ignorance]], or potentially due to the limitations of language and understanding of language. These delineations include not only the ignorance of the right [[Psychology of reasoning|reasoning standard]] but also the ignorance of relevant properties of the [[Context (language use)|context]]. For instance, the [[soundness]] of [[legal argument]]s depends on the context in which they are made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Argument types and fallacies in legal argumentation |date=2015 |publisher=Springer International Publishing |isbn=978-3-319-16147-1 |editor-last=Bustamente |editor-first=Thomas |location=Heidelberg |page=x |editor-last2=Dahlman |editor-first2=Christian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fallacies are commonly divided into "formal" and "informal". A [[formal fallacy]] is a flaw in the structure of a [[deductive reasoning|deductive]] [[logical argument|argument]] that renders the argument invalid, while an [[informal fallacy]] originates in an error in reasoning other than an improper [[logical form]].&lt;ref name="garns"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Garns |first=Rudy |date=1997 |title=Informal Fallacies |url=http://www.nku.edu/~garns/165/ppt3_2.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170201173411/http://www.nku.edu/~garns/165/ppt3_2.html |archive-date=2017-02-01 |access-date=2013-09-10 |publisher=Northern Kentucky University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arguments containing informal fallacies may be formally [[Validity (logic)|valid]], but still fallacious.&lt;ref name="Downden"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Dowden |first=Bradley |title=Fallacy |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/fallacy |access-date=17 February 2016 |website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A special case is a [[mathematical fallacy]], an intentionally invalid [[mathematical proof]] with a concealed, or subtle, error. Mathematical fallacies are typically crafted and exhibited for educational purposes, usually taking the form of false proofs of obvious [[contradiction]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Mathematical Fallacies |url=https://brilliant.org/wiki/mathematical-fallacies/ |access-date=4 February 2023 |website=brilliant.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Fallacies are types of erroneous reasoning that render arguments [[Soundness|logically unsound]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Definition of fallacy |url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/fallacy |access-date=2023-02-18 |website=www.dictionary.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to The New Handbook of Cognitive Therapy Techniques, they include "unsubstantiated assertions that are often delivered with a conviction that makes them sound as though they are proven facts".&lt;ref name="The new handbook of cognitive..."&gt;{{Cite book |last=McMullin |first=Rian E. |title=The new handbook of cognitive therapy techniques |date=2000 |publisher=W.W. Norton |isbn=978-0393703139 |edition=Rev. |location=New York |oclc=41580357}}&lt;/ref&gt; Informal fallacies, in particular, are frequently found in mass media such as television and newspapers.&lt;ref name="McMurty1990"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=McMurtry |first=John |date=December 1990 |title=The mass media: An analysis of their system of fallacy |journal=Interchange |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=49–66 |doi=10.1007/BF01810092 |s2cid=144780081}}&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding fallacies may allow one to recognize them in either one's own or others' writing. Avoiding fallacies may help improve one's ability to produce sound arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=14 March 2017 |title=The Importance of Logical Fallacies |url=https://thelogicofscience.com/2017/03/14/the-importance-of-logical-fallacies/ |access-date=4 February 2023 |website=thelogicofscience.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It can be difficult to evaluate whether an argument is fallacious, as arguments exist along a continuum of soundness and an argument that has several stages or parts might have some sound sections and some fallacious ones.&lt;ref name="DeLancey_Handout"&gt;{{Cite web |last=DeLancey |first=Craig|title=Evaluating Arguments – Distinguishing between reasonable and fallacious tactics |url=https://writingcenter.ua.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/evaluatingarguments.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130903171329/http://writingcenter.ua.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/evaluatingarguments.pdf |archive-date=2013-09-03 |access-date=7 March 2018 |website=oswego.edu |publisher=self-published}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, whether a specific argument is fallacious often depends on the content rather than the form of the argument. An example is a [[Validity (statistics)|probabilistically valid]] instance of the formally invalid argument form of [[denying the antecedent]] or [[affirming the consequent]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Godden |first1=David |last2=Zenker |first2=Frank |date=2015-03-05 |title=Denying Antecedents and Affirming Consequents: The State of the Art |url=http://ojs.uwindsor.ca/ojs/leddy/index.php/informal_logic/article/view/4173 |journal=Informal Logic |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=88 |doi=10.22329/il.v35i1.4173 |issn=0824-2577 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, "fallacious arguments usually have the deceptive appearance of being good arguments, &lt;ref name="Damer 2009"&gt;{{Citation |last=Damer |first=T. Edward |title=[[Attacking Faulty Reasoning]]: A Practical Guide to Fallacy-free Arguments |page=52 |year=2009 |edition=6th |place=Belmont, California |publisher=Wadsworth |isbn=978-0-495-09506-4 |author-link=T. Edward Damer}}&lt;/ref&gt; because for most fallacious instances of an argument form, a similar but non-fallacious instance can be found". Evaluating an instance of an argument as fallacious is therefore often a matter of evaluating the context of the argument.   

Recognizing fallacies in everyday arguments may be difficult since arguments are often embedded in [[rhetoric]]al patterns that obscure the logical connections between statements. Informal fallacies may also exploit the [[emotion]]al, intellectual, or [[psychology|psychological]] weaknesses of the audience. Recognizing fallacies can develop reasoning skills to expose the weaker links between premises and conclusions to better discern between what appears to be true and what is true.

[[Argumentation theory]] provides a different approach to understanding and classifying fallacies. In the [[pragma-dialectics|pragma-dialectical theory]], for instance, an argument is regarded as an interactive protocol between individuals who attempt to resolve their disagreement on the merits of a case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Frans van |first=Eemeren |url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1048664485 |title=Argumentation Theory : a Pragma-Dialectical Perspective |date=2018 |publisher=Springer International Publishing |isbn=978-3-319-95380-9 |oclc=1048664485}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protocol consists of [[Pragma-dialectics|normative rules of interaction]], and violations of these rules are considered fallacies because they frustrate the attempt at resolving the disagreement.

Fallacies are used in place of valid reasoning to communicate a point with the intention to persuade. Examples in the [[mass media]] today include but are not limited to [[propaganda]], [[advertisement]]s, [[politics]], newspaper editorials, and opinion-based news shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Fallacies in Propaganda |url=https://www.termpaperwarehouse.com/essay-on/Fallacies-In-Propaganda/5CEBA75592A5824A |access-date=4 February 2023 |website=www.termpaperwarehouse.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== &lt;span id="Material fallacy"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Systems of classification ==
Fallacies are generally classified strictly by either their structure or their content, such as by classifying them as [[Formal fallacy|formal fallacies]] or [[Informal fallacy|informal fallacies]], respectively. The classification of informal fallacies may be subdivided into categories such as linguistic, relevance through omission, relevance through intrusion, and relevance through presumption.&lt;ref name="Pirie2006"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Pirie |first=Madsen |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gh5UjNNc0v4C&amp;pg=PA46 |title=How to Win Every Argument: The Use and Abuse of Logic |publisher=A&amp;C Black |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-8264-9006-3 |page=46 |author-link=Madsen Pirie |access-date=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, fallacies may be classified by the process by which they occur, such as [[Material fallacy|material fallacies]] (content), [[Verbal fallacy|verbal fallacies]] (linguistic), and formal fallacies (error in inference). In turn, material fallacies may be placed into the more general category of informal fallacies. Verbal fallacies may be placed in either formal or informal classifications: Compare [[equivocation]], which is a word- or phrase-based [[ambiguity]], to the [[fallacy of composition]], which is premise- and inference-based ambiguity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=fallacy |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/fallacy#toc280530 |access-date=13 June 2017 |website=|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== &lt;span id="Verbal fallacy"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Greek logic ===
The Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC) was the first to systematize logical errors into a list to make it easier to refute an opponent's thesis and thus win an argument.&lt;ref name="eem"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=van Eemeren |first1=Frans |title=Fallacies and judgements of reasonableness, Empirical Research Concerning the Pragma-Dialectical Discussion Rules |last2=Garssen |first2=Bart |last3=Meuffels |first3=Bert |date=2009 |publisher=Springer Science+Business Media B.V. |isbn=978-90-481-2613-2 |location=Dordrecht |language=en |chapter=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}} Aristotle's ''[[Sophistical Refutations]]'' ({{transliteration|el|De Sophisticis Elenchis}}) identifies thirteen fallacies. He divided them up into two major types: linguistic fallacies and non-linguistic fallacies, some of which depend on language and others that do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=March 13, 2008 |title=Aristotle's original 13 fallacies |url=http://thenonsequitur.com/?page_id=621 |access-date=28 May 2013 |publisher=The Non Sequitur}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Aristotle's 13 fallacies |url=http://www.logiclaw.co.uk/fallacies/Straker3.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180718072028/http://www.logiclaw.co.uk/fallacies/Straker3.html |archive-date=2018-07-18 |access-date=2017-12-12 |website=www.logiclaw.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; These fallacies are called verbal fallacies and material fallacies, respectively. A [[material fallacy]] is an error in what the arguer is talking about, while a [[verbal fallacy]] is an error in how the arguer is talking. Verbal fallacies are those in which a conclusion is obtained by improper or ambiguous use of words.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=PHIL 495: Philosophical Writing (Spring 2008), Texas A&amp;M University |url=http://aristotle.tamu.edu/~rasmith/Courses/PhilosophicalWriting/08a/fallacies.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905215503/http://aristotle.tamu.edu/~rasmith/Courses/PhilosophicalWriting/08a/fallacies.html |archive-date=2008-09-05 |access-date=2013-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An example of a language dependent fallacy is given as a debate as to who in humanity are learners: the wise or the ignorant.{{r|eem|page1=3}} A language-independent fallacy is, for example:
# "[[Coriscus of Scepsis|Coriscus]] is different from [[Socrates]]."
# "Socrates is a man."
# "Therefore, Coriscus is different from a man."{{r|eem|page1=4}}

=== &lt;span id="Verbal fallacy"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Indian logic ===
[[Indian logic|Indian logicians]] took great pains to identify fallacies in arguments. An influential collection of texts on logic and reason, the ''[[Nyāya Sūtras]]'', attributed to [[Aksapada Gautama]], variously estimated to have been composed between the 6th century BCE and the 2nd century CE, lists in its theory of inference five such reasons used in an argument that was further developed by later logicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Epistemology in Classical Indian Philosophy |encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2019/entries/epistemology-india/ |access-date=2021-05-07 |last=Phillips |first=Stephen |date=2019 |editor-last=Zalta |editor-first=Edward N. |edition=Spring 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Mahamahopadhyaya Satisa Chandra Vidyabhushana |url=http://archive.org/details/NyayaSutrasOfGautama |title=The Nyaya Sutras Of Gautama (English)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Analytic Philosophy in Early Modern India |encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2019/entries/early-modern-india/ |access-date=2021-05-07 |last=Ganeri |first=Jonardon |date=2019 |editor-last=Zalta |editor-first=Edward N. |edition=Summer 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# ''Asiddha'': It is the unproved reason that results in this fallacy. [Paksadharmata]
# ''Savyabhichara'': This is the fallacy of irregular reason.
# ''Satpratipaksa'': Here the reason is contradicted by another reason. If both have equal force, then nothing follows. 'Sound is eternal, because it is audible', and 'Sound is non-eternal, because it is produced'. Here 'audible' is counterbalanced by 'produced' and both are of equal force.
# ''Badhita'': When another proof (as by perception) definitely contradicts and disproves the middle term (reason). 'Fire is cold because it is a substance'.
# ''Viruddha'': Instead of proving something it is proving the opposite. 'Sound is eternal because it is produced'.

=== Whately's grouping ===
English scholar and theologian [[Richard Whately]] (1787–1863) defines a fallacy broadly as, "any argument, or apparent argument, which professes to be decisive of the matter at hand, while in reality it is not".{{r|eem|page1=8}}

Whately divided fallacies into two groups: ''logical'' and ''material''. According to Whately, logical fallacies are arguments where the conclusion does not follow from the premises. Material fallacies are not logical errors because the conclusion follows from the premises. He then divided the logical group into two groups: purely logical and semi-logical. The semi-logical group included all of Aristotle's [[sophisms]] except ''[[ignoratio elenchi]]'', ''[[petitio principii]]'', and ''[[non causa pro causa]]'', which are in the material group.&lt;ref name="Coffey1912"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Coffey |first=P. |url=https://archive.org/details/thescienceoflogi01coffuoft |title=The Science of Logic |publisher=Longmans, Green, and Co.|year=1912 |isbn=978-0371778951 |edition=1st |volume=1 |page=[https://archive.org/details/thescienceoflogi01coffuoft/page/302 302] |language=en-US |lccn=12018756 |oclc=797892247 |ol=7104938M |access-date=2016-02-22 |ol-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other systems of classification ===
Other famous methods of classifying fallacies are those of [[Francis Bacon (philosopher)|Francis Bacon]] and [[John Stuart Mill|J. S. Mill]]. Bacon (''[[Novum Organum]]'', Aph. 33, 38 sqq.) divided fallacies into four Idola (Idols, i.e. False Appearances), which summarize the various kinds of mistakes to which the human intellect is prone. J. S. Mill discussed the subject in book five of his Logic, and [[Jeremy Bentham]]'s ''Book of Fallacies'' (1824) contains valuable remarks.

== Formal fallacy ==
{{Main|Formal fallacy}}

A formal fallacy, deductive fallacy, [[logical fallacy]] or ''non sequitur'' ([[Latin]] for "it does not follow") is a flaw in the structure of a [[deductive reasoning|deductive]] [[logical argument|argument]] that renders the argument [[Validity (logic)|invalid]]. The flaw can be expressed in the standard system of logic.&lt;ref name="GenslerAZ" /&gt; Such an argument is always considered to be wrong.
The presence of the formal fallacy does not imply anything about the argument's [[premise]]s or its conclusion. Both may actually be true or may even be more probable as a result of the argument, but the deductive argument is still invalid because the conclusion does not follow from the premises in the manner described.

Even non-deductive arguments can be said to be fallacious: for example, an [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]] argument that incorrectly applies principles of probability or [[causality]]. But "since deductive arguments depend on formal properties and inductive arguments don't, formal fallacies apply only to deductive arguments".&lt;ref name="garns" /&gt;

A [[logical form]] such as "''A'' and ''B''" is independent of any particular conjunction of meaningful propositions. Logical form alone can guarantee that, given true premises, a true conclusion must follow. However, formal logic makes no such guarantee if any premise is false; the conclusion can be either true or false. Any formal error or logical fallacy similarly invalidates the deductive guarantee. Both the argument and all its premises must be true for a conclusion to be true.

The term ''non sequitur'' denotes a general formal fallacy, often meaning one that does not belong to any named subclass of formal fallacies, like [[affirming the consequent]].

=== Common examples ===
{{main|List of fallacies#Formal fallacies}}

==== Ecological fallacy ====
An [[ecological fallacy]] is committed when one draws an inference from data based on the premise that qualities observed for groups necessarily hold for individuals; for example, "if countries with more Protestants tend to have higher suicide rates, then Protestants must be more likely to commit suicide".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |year=2004 |title=Ecological Fallacy |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Social Science Research Methods |publisher=Sage |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |last=Freedman |first=David A. |editor-last=Lewis-Beck |editor-first=Michael S. |pages=293–295 |isbn=978-0761923633 |editor2-first=Alan |editor2-last=Bryman |editor3-first=Tim Futing |editor3-last=Liao}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Observational interpretation fallacy ====

The ''[[observational interpretation fallacy]]'' is a cognitive bias that occurs exclusively in the medical field, leading to the mistaken interpretation of observed associations as causal relationships, negatively impacting medical guidelines, clinical decisions, and healthcare practices, potentially compromising patient safety.&lt;ref&gt;D'Amico, F., Marmiere, M., Fonti, M., Battaglia, M., &amp; Belletti, A. (2025). Association Does Not Mean Causation, When Observational Data Were Misinterpreted as Causal: The Observational Interpretation Fallacy.

=== Fallacy fork ===
[[Maarten Boudry]]&lt;ref name=Boudry/&gt; and others&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Eemeren |first1=Frans H. van |title=Handbook of Argumentation Theory |last2=Garssen |first2=Bart |last3=Krabbe |first3=Erik C.

Boudry coined the term ''fallacy fork''.&lt;ref name=Boudry/&gt; For a given fallacy, one must either characterize it by means of a deductive [[argumentation scheme]], which rarely applies (the first prong of the fork), or one must relax definitions and add nuance to take the actual intent and context of the argument into account (the other prong of the fork).&lt;ref name=Boudry/&gt; To argue, for example, that one became nauseated after eating a mushroom because the mushroom was poisonous could be an example of the ''post hoc ergo propter hoc'' fallacy.&lt;ref name="Boudry"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Boudry |first=Maarten |author-link=Maarten Boudry |date=2017 |title=The Fallacy Fork: Why It's Time to Get Rid of Fallacy Theory |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |volume=41 |issue=5 |pages=46–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Informal fallacy ==
{{main|Informal fallacy}}
In contrast to a formal fallacy, an informal fallacy originates from a reasoning error other than a flaw in the logical form of the argument.&lt;ref name="garns" /&gt; A [[deductive argument]] containing an informal fallacy may be formally [[Validity (logic)|valid]],&lt;ref name="Downden" /&gt; but still remain rationally unpersuasive. Nevertheless, informal fallacies apply to both deductive and non-deductive arguments.

Though the form of the argument may be relevant, fallacies of this type are "types of mistakes in reasoning that arise from the mishandling of the ''content'' of the propositions constituting the argument".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Copi |first1=Irving M. |title=Introduction to Logic |last2=Cohen |first2=Carl |publisher=Pearson Education, Inc. |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-13-189834-9 |edition=12th|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Faulty generalization ===
A special subclass of the informal fallacies is the set of [[faulty generalization]]s, also known as inductive fallacies. Here, the most important issue concerns inductive strength or methodology (for example, [[statistical inference]]). In the absence of sufficient evidence, drawing conclusions based on induction is [[Warrant (rhetoric)|unwarranted]] and fallacious. With the backing of sufficient amounts of the right type of [[empirical evidence]], however, the conclusions may become warranted and convincing (at which point the arguments are no longer considered fallacious).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Neyman |first=J. |date=1937-08-30 |title=Outline of a Theory of Statistical Estimation Based on the Classical Theory of Probability |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series A, Mathematical and Physical Sciences |language=en |volume=236 |issue=767 |pages=333–380 |bibcode=1937RSPTA.236..333N |doi=10.1098/rsta.1937.0005 |issn=0080-4614 |s2cid=19584450 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hasty generalization ====
[[Hasty generalization]] is described as making assumptions about a whole group or range of cases based on a [[Sample (statistics)|sample]] that is inadequate (usually because it is atypical or just too small).
Stereotypes about people ("frat boys are drunkards", "grad students are nerdy", "women don't enjoy sports", etc.) are common examples of the principle.

Hasty generalization often follows a pattern such as:

:X is true for A.
:X is true for B.
:Therefore, X is true for C, D, etc.

While never a valid logical deduction, if such an inference can be made on statistical grounds, it may nonetheless be convincing. This is because with enough empirical evidence, the generalization is no longer a hasty one.

=== Relevance fallacy ===
The [[fallacy of relevance|fallacies of relevance]] are a broad class of informal fallacies, generically represented by [[missing the point]]: presenting an argument that may be [[soundness|sound]] but fails to address the issue in question.

==== Argument from silence ====
An [[argument from silence]] is a faulty conclusion that is drawn based on the absence of evidence rather than on the presence of evidence.

=== Examples of informal fallacies ===
{{Main|List of fallacies#Informal fallacies}}

==== ''Post hoc'' (false cause) ====
The post hoc fallacy assumes that because B comes after A, A caused B. It gets its name from the Latin phrase "''post hoc, ergo propter hoc''", which translates as "after this, therefore because of this". 

Sometimes one event really does cause another one that comes later—for example, if one registers for a class and their name later appears on the roll, it's true that the first event caused the one that came later. But sometimes two events that seem related in time are not really related as cause and event. That is, [[Correlation does not imply causation|temporal correlation does not necessarily entail causation]]. For example, if one eats a sandwich and then gets food poisoning, that does not necessarily mean the sandwich caused the food poisoning. Something else eaten earlier might have caused the food poisoning.

==== Slippery slope ====
For an argument to be a [[slippery slope]] type of argument, it must meet the requirements of that [[argumentation scheme]]. A slippery slope argument originates from a conversation or debate in which two actors take turns. It usually originates from one actor giving advice on a decision or act. Along the way, the actor must make additional choices on similar matters through which the actor enters the ‘grey area’ of the slippery slope. At this point, the actor potentially loses control over the direction of the arguments, thus leading to a ‘fatal’ outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Walton |first=Douglas |date=2015-09-02 |title=The Basic Slippery Slope Argument |url=https://informallogic.ca/index.php/informal_logic/article/view/4286 |journal=Informal Logic |language=en |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=273–311 |doi=10.22329/il.v35i3.4286 |issn=2293-734X |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such an argument is built up according to the following argumentation scheme: initial premise, sequential premise, indeterminacy premise, control premise, loss of control premise, catastrophic outcome premise, and conclusion. Slippery slope arguments may be defeated by asking critical questions or giving counterarguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Walton |first=Douglas |title=Slippery Slope Arguments. |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1992 |isbn=978-0198239253 |location=Oxford |language=EN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several reasons for a slippery slope to be fallacious: for example, the argument is going too far into the future, it is a too complex argument whose structure is hard to identify, or the argument makes emotional appeals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Govier |first=Trudy |date=June 1982 |title=What's Wrong with Slippery Slope Arguments? |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0045509100009796/type/journal_article |journal=Canadian Journal of Philosophy |language=en |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=303–316 |doi=10.1080/00455091.1982.10715799 |issn=0045-5091 |s2cid=170107849|url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It may be that a slippery slope is not necessarily fallacious if context is taken into account and there is an effort to assess plausibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Dwyer |first=Christopher |date=September 13, 2019 |title=Critically Thinking About the Slippery Slope "Fallacy" |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/thoughts-thinking/201909/critically-thinking-about-the-slippery-slope-fallacy |website=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== False analogy ====
Informally known as the "[[apples and oranges]]" fallacy, a [[false analogy]] uses unsound comparisons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Kornprobst |first=Markus |year=2007 |title=Comparing Apples and Oranges? Leading and Misleading Uses of Historical Analogies |journal=Millennium&amp;nbsp;— Journal of International Studies |volume=36 |pages=29–49 |doi=10.1177/03058298070360010301 |s2cid=145785208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Straw man fallacy ====
The [[straw man]] fallacy refers to the refutation of a standpoint in an argument that was never proposed. The fallacy usually occurs in the presentation of an opponent's standpoint as more extreme, distorted, or simplistic than it actually is. Compared to criticizing the opponent's actual standpoint, this allows the arguer to offer a seeming refutation of what is, however, not the actual standpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Lewiński |first1=Marcin |last2=Oswald |first2=Steve |date=2013-12-01 |title=When and how do we deal with straw men?

The opponent's argument is not reflected by the arguments that are proposed by the speaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Talisse |first1=Robert |last2=Aikin |first2=Scott F. |date=2006-09-01 |title=Two Forms of the Straw Man |journal=Argumentation |language=en |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=345–352 |url=https://www.academia.edu/48271903 |url-access=registration |doi=10.1007/s10503-006-9017-8 |issn=1572-8374 |s2cid=15523437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measurement fallacy ==
Some of the fallacies described above may be committed in the context of measurement.
Where [[mathematical fallacies]] are subtle mistakes in reasoning leading to invalid mathematical proofs, measurement fallacies are unwarranted inferential leaps involved in the extrapolation of raw data to a measurement-based value claim. The ancient Greek Sophist [[Protagoras]] was one of the first thinkers to propose that humans can generate reliable measurements through his "human-measure" principle and the practice of ''dissoi logoi'' (arguing multiple sides of an issue).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Schiappa |first=Edward |title=Protagoras and Logos: A Study in Greek Philosophy and Rhetoric |publisher=University of South Carolina Press |year=1991 |isbn=978-0872497580 |location=Columbia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Protagoras |url=https://archive.org/details/oldersophistscom0000unse |title=The Older Sophists |publisher=Hackett Publishing Co. |year=1972 |isbn=978-0872205567 |location=Indianapolis, IN |url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt; This history helps explain why measurement fallacies are informed by [[informal logic]] and [[argumentation theory]].

=== Knowledge value measurement fallacy ===
The increasing availability and circulation of [[big data]] are driving a proliferation of new metrics for scholarly authority,&lt;ref name="Meho"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Meho |first=Lokman I. |year=2007 |title=The Rise and Rise of Citation Analysis |journal=[[Physics World]] |volume=January |pages=32–36 |arxiv=physics/0701012 |bibcode=2007physics...1012M |doi=10.1088/2058-7058/20/1/33 |s2cid=16532275}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Jensen |first=Michael |date=June 15, 2007 |title=The New Metrics of Scholarly Authority |work=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] |publisher=The Chron |editor-last=Riley |editor-first=Michael G. |url=http://chronicle.com/article/The-New-Metrics-of-Scholarly/5449 |access-date=28 October 2013 |issn=0009-5982 |oclc=1554535}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there is lively discussion regarding the relative usefulness of such metrics for measuring the value of knowledge production in the context of an "information tsunami".&lt;ref name="Baveye 2010 191–215"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Baveye |first=Phillippe C. |year=2010 |title=Sticker Shock and Looming Tsunami: The High Cost of Academic Serials in Perspective |journal=[[Journal of Scholarly Publishing]] |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=191–215 |doi=10.1353/scp.0.0074 |s2cid=145424660}}&lt;!--|access-date=28 October 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, [[anchoring]] fallacies can occur when unwarranted weight is given to data generated by metrics that the arguers themselves acknowledge are flawed. For example, the limitations of the [[journal impact factor]] (JIF) are well documented,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=National Communication Journal |url=http://www.natcom.org/uploadedFiles/More_Scholarly_Resources/CCA%20Impact%20Factor%20Report%20Final.pdf |title=Impact Factors, Journal Quality, and Communication Journals: A Report for the Council of Communication Associations |publisher=National Communication Association |year=2013 |location=Washington, D.C. |access-date=2016-02-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404212454/http://www.natcom.org/uploadedFiles/More_Scholarly_Resources/CCA%20Impact%20Factor%20Report%20Final.pdf |archive-date=April 4, 2016 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even JIF pioneer Eugene Garfield notes that, "while citation data create new tools for analyses of research performance, it should be stressed that they supplement rather than replace other quantitative and qualitative indicators".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Garfield |first=Eugene |year=1993 |title=What Citations Tell us About Canadian Research |journal=Canadian Journal of Library and Information Science |volume=18 |issue=4 |page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the extent that arguers jettison the acknowledged limitations of JIF-generated data in evaluative judgments or leave behind Garfield's "supplement rather than replace" caveat, they commit anchoring fallacies.

The [[observational interpretation fallacy]] is the [[cognitive bias]] where association identified in observational studies are misinterpreted as [[causal relationship]]s.

A [[naturalistic fallacy]] can occur, for example, in the case of sheer quantity metrics based on the premise "more is better"&lt;ref name="Baveye 2010 191–215" /&gt; or, in the case of developmental assessment in the field of psychology, "higher is better".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Stein |first=Zachary |date=October 2008 |title=Myth Busting and Metric Making: Refashioning the Discourse about Development |url=http://www.archive-ilr.com/archives-2008/2008-10/2008-10-article-stein.php |journal=Integral Leadership Review |volume=8 |issue=5 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20131030094158/http://www.archive-ilr.com/archives-2008/2008-10/2008-10-article-stein.php |archive-date=October 30, 2013 |access-date=October 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[false analogy]] occurs when claims are supported by unsound comparisons between data points. For example, the [[Scopus]] and [[Web of Science]] bibliographic databases have difficulty distinguishing between citations of scholarly work that are arms-length endorsements, ceremonial citations, or negative citations (indicating the citing author withholds endorsement of the cited work).&lt;ref name=Meho/&gt; Hence, measurement-based value claims premised on the uniform quality of all citations may be questioned on false analogy grounds.

As another example, consider the [[Faculty Scholarly Productivity Index]] of Academic Analytics. This tool purports to measure overall faculty productivity, yet it does not capture data based on citations in books. This creates a possibility that low productivity measurements using the tool commit [[argument from silence]] fallacies, to the extent that such measurements are supported by the absence of book citation data.

[[Ecological fallacy|Ecological fallacies]] can be committed when one measures the scholarly productivity of a sub-group of individuals (e.g. "Puerto Rican" faculty) via reference to aggregate data about a larger and different group (e.g., "Hispanic" faculty).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Allen |first=Henry L. |year=1997 |title=Faculty Workload and Productivity: Ethnic and Gender Disparities |url=http://www.nea.org/assets/img/PubAlmanac/ALM_97_04.pdf |url-status=dead |journal=NEA 1997 Almanac of Higher Education |page=39 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150707001555/http://www.nea.org/assets/img/PubAlmanac/ALM_97_04.pdf |archive-date=July 7, 2015 |access-date=October 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Intentional fallacy ==
Sometimes a speaker or writer uses a fallacy intentionally. In any context, including academic debate, a conversation among friends, political discourse, advertising, or comedic purposes, the arguer may use fallacious reasoning to try to persuade the listener or reader, by means other than offering relevant evidence, that the conclusion is true.

Examples of this include the speaker or writer:&lt;ref name="Shewan"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Shewan |first=Edward |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=22s9JWeHJbAC&amp;pg=PA92 |title=Applications of Grammar: Principles of Effective Communication |publisher=Christian Liberty Press |year=2003 |isbn=978-1-930367-28-9 |edition=2nd |chapter=Soundness of Argument |access-date=February 22, 2016 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=22s9JWeHJbAC&amp;pg=PA84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In humor, errors of reasoning are used for comical purposes. Groucho Marx used fallacies of [[amphiboly]], for instance, to make ironic statements; [[Gary Larson]] and [[Scott Adams]] employed fallacious reasoning in many of their cartoons. Wes Boyer and Samuel Stoddard have written a humorous essay teaching students how to be persuasive by means of a whole host of informal and formal fallacies.&lt;ref name="How to Be Persuasive"&gt;{{Cite web |last1=Boyer |first1=Web |last2=Stoddard |first2=Samuel |title=How to Be Persuasive |url=http://www.rinkworks.com/persuasive/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180727043805/http://www.rinkworks.com/persuasive/ |archive-date=July 27, 2018 |access-date=December 5, 2012 |website=Rink Works}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walton}}&lt;/ref&gt; a fallacy can be either a heuristic error or a ploy used intentionally to unfairly win an argument. There are always two parties to an argument containing a fallacy: the perpetrator and the intended victim. 

The dialogue framework required to support the pragmatic theory of fallacy is built on the presumption that argumentative dialogue has both an adversarial component and a collaborative component. A dialogue has individual goals for each participant as well as shared goals that apply to all participants. A fallacy of the second kind is seen as more than simply a violation of the rule of reasonable dialogue. It is also a deceptive tactic of argumentation based on sleight-of-hand. Aristotle explicitly compared contentious reasoning to unfair fighting in athletic contests. But the roots of the pragmatic theory go back even further in history, to the Sophists. The pragmatic theory finds its roots in the Aristotelian conception of a fallacy as a sophistical refutation but also supports the view that many of the types of arguments traditionally labeled as fallacies are in fact reasonable techniques of argumentation that can be used, in many cases, to support legitimate goals of dialogue. Hence, under the pragmatic approach, each case needs to be analyzed individually to determine whether the argument is fallacious or reasonable.

[[File:FACTS ubt 2.JPG|thumb|300px|Non-fiction books at a Danish library, shelves displaying the word {{Lang|da|Fakta}}, Danish for "Facts"]]

A '''fact''' is a [[truth|true]] [[data|datum]] about one or more aspects of a circumstance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Definition of fact {{!}} Dictionary.com |url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/fact |access-date=2023-05-17 |website=www.dictionary.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Standard [[reference works]] are often used to [[Fact-checking|check facts]]. [[Science|Scientific]] facts are verified by repeatable careful observation or measurement by [[experiments]] or other means.

For example, "This sentence contains words." accurately describes a [[linguistic]] fact, and "The Sun is a star" accurately describes an [[astronomical]] fact. Further, "[[Abraham Lincoln]] was the 16th President of the United States" and "Abraham Lincoln was assassinated" both accurately describe [[history|historical]] facts. Generally speaking, facts are independent of [[belief]] and of [[knowledge]] and [[opinion]].

Facts are different from [[inference]]s, [[theories]], [[values]], and [[Object (philosophy)|objects]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Mulligan |first1=Kevin |title=Facts |date=2021 |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2021/entries/facts/ |encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |editor-last=Zalta |editor-first=Edward N. |edition=Winter 2021 |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |quote=Facts, philosophers like to say, are opposed to theories and to values (cf. Rundle 1993) and are to be distinguished from things, in particular from complex objects, complexes and wholes, and from relations. |access-date=2022-11-18 |last2=Correia |first2=Fabrice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and usage==

The word ''fact'' derives from the Latin ''factum''. It was first used in English with the same meaning: "a thing done or performed"{{spaced en dash}}a meaning now obsolete outside the law.&lt;ref name="Exp. Dan"&gt;"Fact" (1a). Oxford English Dictionary_2d_Ed_1989 Joye ''Exp. Dan.'' xi. Z vij b, ''Let emprours and kinges know this godly kynges fact. 1545''(but note the conventional uses: ''after the fact'' and ''before the fact'')&lt;/ref&gt; The common usage of "something that has really occurred or is the case" dates from the mid-16th century.&lt;ref name="Exp. Dan"/&gt;

Barbara J. Shapiro wrote in her book ''A Culture of Fact'' how the concept of a fact evolved, starting within the English legal tradition of the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Shapiro |first=Barbara J. |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41606276 |title=A culture of fact : England, 1550-1720 |date=2000 |publisher=Cornell University Press |isbn=0-8014-3686-9 |location=Ithaca |language=en |oclc=41606276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1870, [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] described in his book ''The Fixation of Belief'' four methods which people use to decide what they should believe: tenacity, method of authority, a priori and scientific method.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Sanders Peirce. ''The Fixation of Belief'' paperback – July 26, 2017 {{ISBN|1973922991}}, 38 pp&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''fact'' also indicates a ''matter under discussion'' deemed to be true or correct, such as to emphasize a point or prove a disputed issue; (e.g., "...&amp;nbsp;the ''fact'' of the matter is ...").&lt;ref&gt;"Fact" (6c). Oxford English Dictionary_2d_Ed_1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(See also "Matter" (2,6). ''Compact_Oxford English Dictionary'')&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, ''fact'' may also indicate an [[allegation]] or [[stipulation]] of something that may or may not be a ''true fact'',&lt;ref&gt;"Fact" (5). Oxford English Dictionary_2d_Ed_1989&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g., "the author's facts are not trustworthy"). This alternate usage, although contested by some, has a long history in standard English according to the ''American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language.&lt;ref&gt;''American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language''_4th_Ed.&lt;/ref&gt;'' The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' dates this use to 1729.&lt;ref&gt;"Fact" (5). Oxford English Dictionary_2d_Ed_1989&lt;/ref&gt;

''Fact'' may also indicate findings derived through a ''process of evaluation'', including review of testimony, direct observation, or otherwise; as distinguishable from matters of inference or speculation.&lt;ref&gt;"Fact" (6a). Oxford English Dictionary_2d_Ed_1989&lt;/ref&gt; This use is reflected in the terms "fact-find" and "fact-finder" (e.g., "set up a [[Trier of fact|fact-finding]] commission").&lt;ref&gt;"Fact" (8). Oxford English Dictionary_2d_Ed_1989&lt;/ref&gt;

Facts may be checked by reason, experiment, personal experience, or may be argued from authority. [[Roger Bacon]] wrote "If in other sciences we should arrive at certainty without doubt and truth without error, it behooves us to place the foundations of knowledge in mathematics."&lt;ref&gt;Roger Bacon, translated by Robert Burke ''Opus Majus'', Book I, Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In philosophy==

In [[philosophy]], the concept ''fact'' is considered in the branch of philosophy concerned with knowledge, called [[epistemology]] and [[ontology]], which studies concepts such as [[existence]], [[being]], [[Becoming (philosophy)|becoming]], and [[reality]]. Questions of [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]] and truth are closely associated with questions of fact. A fact can be defined as something that is the case, in other words, a [[State of affairs (philosophy)|state of affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;"A fact, it might be said, is a state of affairs that is the case or obtains." – [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/states-of-affairs/ Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy. ''States of Affairs'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein, ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]],'' Proposition 2: What is the case—a fact—is the existence of states of affairs.&lt;/ref&gt;

Facts may be understood as [[information]], which makes a true sentence true: "A fact is, traditionally, the worldly correlate of a true proposition, a state of affairs whose obtaining makes that proposition true."&lt;ref name="ocp"&gt;Oxford Companion to Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; Facts may also be understood as those things to which a true sentence refers. The statement "Jupiter is the largest planet in the Solar System" is ''about'' the fact that Jupiter is the largest planet in the [[Solar System]].&lt;ref&gt;Alex Oliver, ''Fact'', in {{cite book
| title     = Shorter Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy
| first     = Edward
| last      = Craig
| publisher = Routledge, Oxford
| year      = 2005
| isbn        = 0-415-32495-5
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Correspondence and the slingshot argument===

[[Pascal Engel|Pascal Engel's]] version of the [[correspondence theory of truth]] explains that what makes a sentence true is that it ''corresponds'' to a fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| title     = Truth
| first     = Pascal
| last      = Engel
| publisher = McGill-Queen's Press – MQUP
| year      = 2002
| isbn        = 0-7735-2462-2
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory presupposes the existence of an objective world.

The [[Slingshot argument]] claims to show that all true statements stand for the same thing, the [[truth value]] ''true''. If this argument holds, and facts are taken to be what true statements stand for, then one arrives at the counter-intuitive conclusion that there is only one fact: ''the truth''.&lt;ref&gt;The argument is presented in many places, but see for example [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Davidson]], ''Truth and Meaning'', in {{cite book
| title     = Truth and Interpretation
| first     = Donald
| last      = Davidson
| publisher = Clarendon Press, Oxford
| year      = 1984
| isbn        = 0-19-824617-X
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compound facts===

Any non-trivial true statement about [[reality]] is necessarily an abstraction composed of a complex of [[object (philosophy)|objects]] and [[property (philosophy)|properties]] or [[relations (philosophy)|relations]]. Facts "possess internal structure, being complexes of objects and properties or relations".&lt;ref name="ocp"/&gt; For example, the fact described by the true statement "Paris is the capital city of France" implies that there is such a place as Paris, there is such a place as France, there are such things as capital cities, as well as that France has a government, that the government of France has the power to define its capital city, and that the French government has chosen Paris to be the capital, that there is such a thing as a ''place'' or a ''government'', and so on. The verifiable accuracy of all of these assertions, if facts themselves, may coincide to create the fact, that Paris is the capital of France.

Difficulties arise, however, in attempting to identify the constituent parts of negative, modal, disjunctive, or moral facts.&lt;ref&gt;''Fact'', in ''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy'', Ted Honderich, editor. (Oxford, 1995) {{ISBN|0-19-866132-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fact–value distinction===
{{Main|Fact–value distinction}}

Moral philosophers since [[David Hume#Ethics|David Hume]] have debated whether [[values]] are objective, and thus factual. In ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'' Hume pointed out there is no obvious way for a series of statements about what ''ought'' to be the case to be derived from a series of statements of what ''is'' the case.  This is called the [[is–ought distinction]].  Those who insist there is a logical gulf between [[Fact–value distinction|facts and values]], such that it is fallacious to attempt to derive values (e.g., "it is good to give food to hungry people") from facts (e.g., "people will die if they can't eat"), include [[G. E. Moore]], who called attempting to do so the [[naturalistic fallacy]].

===Factual–counterfactual distinction===
{{Main|Counterfactual conditional}}

[[Factuality]]—what has occurred—can also be contrasted with counterfactuality: what ''might have'' occurred, but did not. A counterfactual conditional or [[subjunctive conditional]] is a conditional (or "if–then") statement indicating what ''would be'' the case if events had been other than they were. For example, "If Alexander had lived, his empire would have been greater than Rome." This contrasts with an indicative conditional, which indicates what ''is'' (in fact) the case if its antecedent ''is'' (in fact) true—for example, "If you drink this, it will make you well." Such sentences are important to [[modal logic]], especially since the development of [[possible world]] semantics.{{Citation needed|date=July 2021}}

==In mathematics==

In mathematics, a ''fact'' is a statement (called a [[theorem]]) that can be proven by logical argument from certain [[axiom]]s and [[definition]]s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2021}}

==In science==
{{Further|Scientific method|Philosophy of science}}

The definition of a ''scientific fact'' is different from the definition of fact, as it implies [[knowledge]]. A scientific fact is the result of a repeatable careful observation or measurement by experimentation or other means, also called [[empirical evidence]]. These are central to building [[scientific theories]]. Various forms of observation and measurement lead to fundamental questions about the [[scientific method]], and the scope and validity of [[Philosophy of science|scientific reasoning]].

In the most basic sense, a ''scientific fact'' is an objective and verifiable observation, in contrast with a ''[[hypothesis]]'' or ''[[Scientific theory|theory]]'', which is intended to explain or interpret facts.&lt;ref name="Gower"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Gower |first=Barry |title=Scientific Method: A Historical and Philosophical Introduction |publisher=Routledge |year=1997 |isbn=0-415-12282-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various [[scholars]] have offered significant refinements to this basic formulation. Philosophers and scientists are careful to distinguish between: 1) ''states of affairs'' in the external world and 2) ''assertions'' of fact that may be considered relevant in scientific analysis. The term is used in both senses in the philosophy of science.&lt;ref name="Ravetz000"&gt;{{cite book
| title     = Scientific Knowledge and Its Social Problems
| first     = Jerome Raymond
| last      = Ravetz
| publisher = Transaction Publishers
| year      = 1996
| isbn        = 1-56000-851-2
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars and clinical researchers in both the social and natural sciences have written about numerous questions and theories that arise in the attempt to clarify the fundamental nature of scientific fact.&lt;ref name="Gower"/&gt; Pertinent issues raised by this inquiry include:
* the process by which "established fact" becomes recognized and accepted as such;&lt;ref name="Ravetz000"/&gt;{{rp|182 fn. 1}}
* whether and to what extent "fact" and "theoretic explanation" can be considered truly independent and separable from one another;&lt;ref name="Ravetz000"/&gt;{{rp|185}}&lt;ref name="Gower"/&gt;{{rp|138}}
* to what extent "facts" are influenced by the mere act of observation;&lt;ref name="Gower"/&gt;{{rp|138}} and
* to what extent factual conclusions are influenced by history and consensus, rather than a strictly systematic methodology.&lt;ref name="Gower"/&gt;{{rp|7}}

Consistent with the idea of [[confirmation holism]], some scholars assert "fact" to be necessarily "theory-laden" to some degree. [[Thomas Kuhn]] points out that knowing what facts to measure, and how to measure them, requires the use of other theories. For example, the age of [[fossils]] is based on [[radiometric dating]], which is justified by reasoning that radioactive decay follows a [[Poisson process]] rather than a [[Bernoulli process]]. Similarly, [[Percy Williams Bridgman]] is credited with the methodological position known as [[operationalism]], which asserts that all observations are not only influenced, but necessarily defined, by the means and assumptions used to measure them.{{Citation needed|date=July 2021}}

===The scientific method===

Apart from the fundamental inquiry into the nature of scientific fact, there remain the practical and social considerations of how fact is investigated, established, and substantiated through the proper application of the scientific method.&lt;ref name="Ravetz000"/&gt;{{rp|181 ff}} Scientific facts are generally believed independent of the observer: no matter who performs a scientific experiment, all observers agree on the outcome.&lt;ref name="The Nature of Suffering and the Goals of Medicine"&gt;Cassell, Eric J. [https://books.google.com/books?id=K1kjFYrliTMC&amp;dq=%22scientific+fact&amp;pg=PA181 The Nature of Suffering and the Goals of Medicine] ''[[Oxford University Press]]''. Retrieved 16 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition to these considerations, there are the social and institutional measures, such as peer review and accreditation, that are intended to promote ''factual accuracy'' among other interests in scientific study.&lt;ref name="Ravetz000"/&gt;

==In history==
{{Further|Historiography}}

A common rhetorical cliché states, "[[History is written by the winners]]". This phrase suggests but does not examine the use of facts in the writing of history.{{Citation needed|date=July 2021}}

[[E. H. Carr]] in his 1961 volume ''[[What is History?]]'' argues that the inherent biases from the gathering of facts makes the objective truth of any historical [[perspective (cognitive)|perspective]] [[idealistic]] and impossible. Facts are, "like fish in the Ocean", of which we may only happen to catch a few, only an indication of what is below the surface. Even a dragnet cannot tell us for certain what it would be like to live below the Ocean's surface. Even if we do not discard any facts (or fish) presented, we will always miss the majority; the site of our fishing, the methods undertaken, the weather and even luck play a vital role in what we will catch. Additionally, the composition of history is inevitably made up by the compilation of many different biases of fact finding – all compounded over time. He concludes that for a historian to attempt a more objective method, one must accept that history can only aspire to a conversation of the present with the past – and that one's methods of fact gathering should be openly examined. The set of highlighted historical facts, and their interpretations, therefore changes over time, and reflect present consensuses.{{Citation needed|date=July 2021}}

===Legal pleadings===
{{Main|Pleading}}

A party (e.g., [[plaintiff]]) to a civil suit generally must clearly state the relevant allegations of fact that form the basis of a [[Claim (legal)|claim]]. The requisite level of precision and particularity of these allegations varies, depending on the rules of civil procedure and jurisdiction. Parties who face uncertainties regarding facts and circumstances attendant to their side in a dispute may sometimes invoke alternative pleading.&lt;ref&gt;Roy W. McDonald, "Alternative Pleading in the United States". ''Columbia Law Review'', Vol. 52, No. 4 (Apr. 1952), pp. 443–478&lt;/ref&gt; In this situation, a party may plead separate sets of facts that when considered together may be contradictory or mutually exclusive. This seemingly logically-inconsistent presentation of facts may be necessary as a safeguard against contingencies such as ''[[res judicata]]'' that would otherwise preclude presenting a claim or defense that depends on a particular interpretation of the underlying facts and ruling of the court.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald 1952&lt;/ref&gt;

Berlin, Boston, MA: De Gruyter Saur.&lt;/ref&gt; Practitioners within and outside the field study the  application and the usage of knowledge in [[organization]]s in addition to the interaction between people, organizations, and any existing [[information system]]s with the aim of creating, replacing, improving, or understanding the information systems.

== Disciplines and related fields ==

Historically, information science has evolved as a transdisciplinary field, both drawing from and contributing to diverse domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yan |first1=Xue-Shan |title=Information Science: Its Past, Present and Future |journal=Information |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=510–527 |date=2011-07-23 |doi=10.3390/info2030510 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Core foundations ===

* Technical and computational: [[informatics]], [[computer science]], [[data science]], [[network science]], [[information theory]], [[discrete mathematics]], [[statistics]] and [[analytics]]

* Information organization: [[library science]], [[archival science]], [[documentation science]], [[knowledge representation language|knowledge representation]], [[Ontology (information science)|ontologies]], [[organization studies]]

* Human dimensions: [[human-computer interaction]], [[cognitive psychology]], [[information behavior]], [[social epistemology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fallis |first=Don |title=Social Epistemology and Information Science |journal=[[Annual Review of Information Science and Technology]] | year=2007 |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=475-519 |doi=10.1002/aris.1440400119}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[philosophy of information]], [[information ethics]] and [[science and technology studies]]

=== Applied contexts ===

Information science methodologies are applied across numerous domains, reflecting the discipline's versatility and relevance. Key application areas include:

* Health and life sciences: [[health informatics]], [[bioinformatics]]
* Cultural and social contexts: [[digital humanities]],  [[computational social science]], [[social media analytics]], [[social informatics]], [[computational linguistics]]
* Spatial information: [[geographic information science]], [[environmental informatics]]
* Organizational settings: [[knowledge management]], [[business analytics]], [[decision support system]]s, [[information economics]]
* Security and governance: [[cybersecurity]], [[intelligence analysis]], [[information policy]], [[IT law]], [[legal informatics]]
* Education and learning: [[educational technology]], [[learning analytics]]

The interdisciplinary nature of information science continues to expand as new technological developments and social practices emerge, creating innovative research frontiers that bridge traditional disciplinary boundaries.

== Foundations ==

=== Scope and approach ===
Information science focuses on understanding [[problem solving|problems]] from the perspective of the stakeholders involved and then applying information and other technologies as needed. In other words, it tackles systemic problems first rather than individual pieces of [[technology]] within that system. In this respect, one can see information science as a response to [[technological determinism]], the belief that technology "develops by its own laws, that it realizes its own potential, limited only by the material resources available and the creativity of its developers. It must therefore be regarded as an autonomous system controlling and ultimately permeating all other subsystems of society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many universities have entire colleges, departments or schools devoted to the study of information science, while numerous information-science scholars work in disciplines such as [[communication]], [[healthcare]], [[computer science]], [[law]], and [[sociology]]. Several institutions have formed an I-School Caucus (see ''[[List of I-Schools]]''), but numerous others besides these also have comprehensive information specializations.

Within information science, current issues {{as of | 2013 | lc = on}} include:
* [[Human–computer interaction]] for science
* [[Groupware]]
* The [[Semantic Web]]
* [[Value sensitive design]]
* [[Iterative design]] processes
* The ways people generate, use and find information

===Definitions===
The first known usage of the term "information science" was in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/information%20science|title=Definition of INFORMATION SCIENCE|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-25|archive-date=2017-09-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170925132248/https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/information%20science|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early definition of Information science (going back to 1968, the year when the ''American Documentation Institute'' renamed itself as the ''American Society for Information Science and Technology'') states:

:"Information science is that discipline that investigates the properties and behavior of information, the forces governing the flow of information, and the means of processing information for optimum accessibility and usability. It is concerned with that body of knowledge relating to the origination, collection, organization, storage, retrieval, interpretation, transmission, transformation, and utilization of information. This includes the authenticity  of information representations in both natural and artificial systems, the use of codes for efficient message transmission, and the study of information processing devices and techniques such as computers and their programming systems. It is an interdisciplinary science derived from and related to such fields as mathematics, logic, linguistics, psychology, computer technology, operations research, the graphic arts, communications, management, and other similar fields. It has both a pure science component, which inquires into the subject without regard to its application, and an applied science component, which develops services and products." {{harv|Borko|1968|p=3}}.&lt;ref&gt;Borko, H. (1968). Information science: What is it? ''American Documentation'' 19(1), 3¬5.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Related terms====
Some authors use [[informatics]] as a synonym for ''information science''. This is especially true when related to the concept developed by [[Alexander Ivanovich Mikhailov|A. I. Mikhailov]] and other Soviet authors in the mid-1960s. The Mikhailov school saw informatics as a discipline related to the study of scientific information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mikhailov | first1 = A.I. | last2 = Chernyl | first2 = A.I. | last3 = Gilyarevskii | first3 = R.S. | year = 1966 | title = Informatika – novoe nazvanie teorii naučnoj informacii | journal = Naučno Tehničeskaja Informacija | volume = 12 | pages = 35–39 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Informatics is difficult to precisely define because of the rapidly evolving and [[interdisciplinary]] nature of the field. Definitions reliant on the nature of the tools used for deriving meaningful information from data are emerging in Informatics academic programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Informatics | author = Texas Woman's University | year = 2015 | url = http://www.twu.edu/math-computer-science/informatics.asp | access-date = 2016-02-17 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160224213806/http://www.twu.edu/math-computer-science/informatics.asp | archive-date = 2016-02-24 | url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regional differences and international terminology complicate the problem. Some people{{which|date=July 2014}} note that much of what is called "Informatics" today was once called "Information Science" – at least in fields such as [[Medical Informatics]]. For example, when library scientists also began to use the phrase "Information Science" to refer to their work, the term "informatics" emerged:
* in the United States as a response by computer scientists to distinguish their work from that of [[library science]]
* in Britain as a term for a science of information that studies natural, as well as artificial or engineered, information-processing systems

Another term discussed as a synonym for "information studies" is "[[information systems]]". [[Brian Campbell Vickery]]'s ''Information Systems'' (1973) placed information systems within IS.&lt;ref&gt;Vickery; B. C. (1973). Information Systems. London: Butterworth.&lt;/ref&gt; {{harvtxt|Ellis|Allen|Wilson|1999}}, on the other hand, provided a bibliometric investigation describing the relation between two ''different'' fields: "information science" and "information systems".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Ellis |first1=D. |last2=Allen |first2=D. |last3=Wilson |first3=T. |date=1999 |title=Information Science and Information Systems: Conjunct Subjects Disjunct Disciplines |work=JASIS |volume=50 |number=12 |pages=1095–1107 |url=http://www.cais-acsi.ca/proceedings/2000/monarch_2000.pdf |archive-date=2012-04-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425073115/http://www.cais-acsi.ca/proceedings/2000/monarch_2000.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophy of information===
{{Main|Philosophy of information}}

Philosophy of information studies conceptual issues arising at the intersection of [[psychology]], [[computer science]], [[information technology]], and [[philosophy]]. It includes the investigation of the conceptual nature and basic principles of [[information]], including its dynamics, utilisation and sciences, as well as the elaboration and application of information-theoretic and computational methodologies to its philosophical problems.&lt;ref&gt;Luciano Floridi, [http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/pci/downloads/introduction.pdf "What is the Philosophy of Information?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316090017/http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/pci/downloads/introduction.pdf |date=2012-03-16 }},   ''Metaphilosophy'', 2002, (33), 1/2.&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Hammarberg pointed out that there is no coherent distinction between information and data: "an Information Processing System (IPS) cannot process data except in terms of whatever representational language is inherent to it, [so] data could not even be apprehended by an IPS without becoming representational in nature, and thus losing their status of being raw, brute, facts."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hammarberg. The cooked and the raw. Journal of Information Science, 3(6):261–267, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ontology ===
{{Main|Ontology (information science)}}

In science and information science, an ontology formally represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a [[Domain of discourse|domain]], and the relationships between those concepts.  It can be used to [[reason]] about the entities within that domain and may be used to describe the domain.

More specifically, an ontology is a model for describing the world that consists of a set of types, properties, and relationship types. Exactly what is provided around these varies, but they are the essentials of an ontology. There is also generally an expectation that there be a close resemblance between the real world and the features of the model in an ontology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=L. M. |last=Garshol |year=2004 |url=http://www.ontopia.net/topicmaps/materials/tm-vs-thesauri.html#N773 |title=Metadata? Thesauri? Taxonomies? Topic Maps! Making sense of it all |access-date=13 October 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017174807/http://www.ontopia.net/topicmaps/materials/tm-vs-thesauri.html#N773 |archive-date=17 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In theory, an ontology is a "formal, explicit specification of a shared conceptualisation".&lt;ref name="TRG93"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Thomas R. |last=Gruber |author-link=Tom Gruber |date=June 1993 |title=A translation approach to portable ontology specifications |journal=[[Knowledge Acquisition]] |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=199–220 |doi=10.1006/knac.1993.1008 |s2cid=15709015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An ontology renders shared [[vocabulary]] and [[taxonomy]] which models a domain with the definition of objects and/or concepts and their properties and relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=F. |last1=Arvidsson |first2=A. |last2=Flycht-Eriksson |url=http://www.ida.liu.se/~janma/SemWeb/Slides/ontologies1.pdf |title=Ontologies I |access-date=26 November 2008 |archive-date=17 December 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217030507/http://www.ida.liu.se/~janma/SemWeb/Slides/ontologies1.pdf |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ontologies are the structural frameworks for organizing information and are used in [[artificial intelligence]], the [[Semantic Web]], [[systems engineering]], [[software engineering]], [[biomedical informatics]], [[library science]], [[enterprise bookmarking]], and [[information architecture]] as a form of [[knowledge representation]] about the world or some part of it. The creation of domain ontologies is also essential to the definition and use of an [[enterprise architecture framework]].

=== Science or discipline?===

Authors such as Ingwersen&lt;ref name="peteringwersen.info"/&gt; argue that informatology has problems defining its own boundaries with other disciplines. According to Popper "Information science operates busily on an ocean of commonsense practical applications, which increasingly involve the computer ... and on commonsense views of language, of communication, of knowledge and Information, computer science is in little better state".&lt;ref&gt;Popper, Karl. (1973). [Objective Knowledge: an Evolutionary Approach. Oxford: Clarendon Press.
] Information and Information Science in Context.&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors, such as Furner, deny that information science is a true science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |id={{Project MUSE|579340}} |last1=Furner |first1=Jonathan |title=Information Science Is Neither |journal=Library Trends |date=2015 |volume=63 |issue=3 |pages=362–377 |doi=10.1353/lib.2015.0009 |hdl=2142/89820 |hdl-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Careers ==

=== Information scientist ===
{{Main|Information scientist}}

An information scientist is an individual, usually with a relevant subject degree or high level of subject knowledge, who provides focused information to scientific and technical research staff in industry or to subject faculty and students in academia. The industry *information specialist/scientist* and the academic information subject specialist/librarian have, in general, similar subject background training, but the academic position holder will be required to hold a second advanced degree—e.g. Master of Library Science (MLS), Military Intelligence (MI), Master of Arts (MA)—in information and library studies in addition to a subject master's.  The title also applies to an individual carrying out research in information science.

=== Systems analyst ===
{{main|Systems analyst}}

A systems analyst works on creating, designing, and improving information systems for a specific need. Often systems analysts work with one or more [[business]]es to evaluate and implement organizational processes and techniques for accessing information in order to improve [[efficiency]] and [[productivity]] within the organization(s).

=== Information professional ===
{{Main|Information professional}}

An information professional is an individual who preserves, organizes, and disseminates information. Information professionals are skilled in the organization and retrieval of recorded knowledge. Traditionally, their work has been with print materials, but these skills are being increasingly used with electronic, visual, audio, and digital materials. Information professionals work in a variety of public, private, non-profit, and academic institutions. Information professionals can also be found within organisational and industrial contexts, and are performing roles that include system design and development and system analysis.

==History==
{{see also|Information history}}

===Early beginnings===
[[File:Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Bernhard Christoph Francke.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], a German [[polymath]] who wrote primarily in Latin and French. His fields of study were [[Metaphysics]], [[Mathematics]], [[Theodicy]].]]
Information science, in studying the collection, [[classification]], manipulation, storage, [[information retrieval|retrieval]] and dissemination of [[information]] has origins in the common stock of human knowledge. Information analysis has been carried out by scholars at least as early as the time of the [[Assyrian Empire]] with the emergence of cultural depositories, what is today known as libraries and archives.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, John Willis. ''The Care Of Books: An Essay On The Development Of Libraries And Their Fittings, From The Earliest Times To The End Of The Eighteenth Century.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1901&lt;/ref&gt; Institutionally, information science emerged in the 19th century along with many other social science disciplines. As a science, however, it finds its institutional roots in the [[history of science]], beginning with publication of the first issues of ''[[Philosophical Transactions]],'' generally considered the first scientific journal, in 1665 by the Royal Society.

The [[institutionalization]] of science occurred throughout the 18th century. In 1731, [[Benjamin Franklin]] established the [[Library Company of Philadelphia]], the first library owned by a group of public citizens, which quickly expanded beyond the realm of books and became a center of [[scientific experimentation]], and which hosted public exhibitions of scientific experiments.&lt;ref&gt;Korty, Margaret Barton. "Benjamin Franklin and Eighteenth Century American Libraries." ''Transactions of the American Philosophical Society'' December vol. 55.9 (1965)&lt;/ref&gt; Benjamin Franklin invested a town in [[Massachusetts]] with a collection of books that the town voted to make available to all free of charge, forming the first [[public library]] of the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://franklinma.virtualtownhall.net/Pages/FranklinMA_Library/libraryhistory |title=Town of Franklin – History of the Franklin Public Library |publisher=Franklinma.virtualtownhall.net |date=2010-06-29 |access-date=2011-05-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724122448/http://franklinma.virtualtownhall.net/Pages/FranklinMA_Library/libraryhistory |archive-date=2011-07-24 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Academie de Chirurgia ([[Paris]]) published ''Memoires pour les Chirurgiens'', generally considered to be the first [[medical journal]], in 1736. The [[American Philosophical Society]], patterned on the [[Royal Society]] ([[London]]), was founded in Philadelphia in 1743. As numerous other scientific journals and societies were founded, [[Alois Senefelder]] developed the concept of [[lithography]] for use in mass printing work in [[Germany]] in 1796.

===19th century===
[[File:Joseph Marie Jacquard.jpg|thumb|left|[[Joseph Marie Jacquard]]]]
By the 19th century the first signs of information science emerged as separate and distinct from other sciences and social sciences but in conjunction with communication and computation. In 1801, [[Joseph Marie Jacquard]] invented a punched card system to control operations of the cloth weaving loom in France. It was the first use of "memory storage of patterns" system.&lt;ref&gt;Reichman, F. (1961). Notched Cards. In R. Shaw (Ed.), The state of the library art (Volume 4, Part 1, pp. 11–55). New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers, The State University, Graduate School of Library Service&lt;/ref&gt; As chemistry journals emerged throughout the 1820s and 1830s,&lt;ref name="Emard 1976"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Emard | first1 = J. P. | year = 1976 | title = An information science chronology in perspective | journal = Bulletin of the American Society for Information Science | volume = 2 | issue = 8| pages = 51–56 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Babbage]] developed his "difference engine", the first step towards the modern computer, in 1822 and his "analytical engine" by 1834. By 1843 [[Richard Hoe]] developed the rotary press, and in 1844 [[Samuel Morse]] sent the first public telegraph message. By 1848 William F. Poole begins the ''Index to Periodical Literature,'' the first general periodical literature index in the US.

In 1854 [[George Boole]] published ''An Investigation into Laws of Thought...,'' which lays the foundations for [[Boolean algebra]], which is later used in [[information retrieval]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = E. S. | year = 1993 | title = On the shoulders of giants: From Boole to Shannon to Taube: The origins and development of computerized information from the mid-19th century to the present | journal = Information Technology and Libraries | volume = 12 | issue = 2| pages = 217–226 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1860 a congress was held at Karlsruhe Technische Hochschule to discuss the feasibility of establishing a systematic and rational nomenclature for chemistry. The congress did not reach any conclusive results, but several key participants returned home with [[Stanislao Cannizzaro]]'s outline (1858), which ultimately convinces them of the validity of his scheme for calculating atomic weights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Skolnik | first1 = H | year = 1976 | title = Milestones in chemical information science: Award symposium on contributions of the Division of Chemical Literature (Information) to the Chemical Society | journal = Journal of Chemical Information and Computer Sciences | volume = 16 | issue = 4| pages = 187–193 | doi=10.1021/ci60008a001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1865, the [[Smithsonian Institution]] began a catalog of current scientific papers, which became the ''International Catalogue of Scientific Papers'' in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Adkinson | first1 = B. W. | year = 1976 | title = Federal government's support of information activities: A historical sketch | journal = Bulletin of the American Society for Information Science | volume = 2 | issue = 8| pages = 24–26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year the Royal Society began publication of its ''Catalogue of Papers'' in London. In 1868, Christopher Sholes, Carlos Glidden, and S. W. Soule produced the [[Sholes and Glidden typewriter|first practical typewriter]]. By 1872 Lord Kelvin devised an analogue computer to predict the tides, and by 1875 [[Frank Stephen Baldwin]] was granted the first US patent for a practical calculating machine that performs four arithmetic functions.&lt;ref name="Emard 1976" /&gt; [[Alexander Graham Bell]] and [[Thomas Edison]] invented the telephone and phonograph in 1876 and 1877 respectively, and the [[American Library Association]] was founded in Philadelphia. In 1879 ''Index Medicus'' was first issued by the Library of the Surgeon General, U.S. Army, with [[John Shaw Billings]] as librarian, and later the library issues ''Index Catalogue,'' which achieved an international reputation as the most complete catalog of medical literature.&lt;ref&gt;Schullian, D. M., &amp; Rogers, F. B. (1958). The National Library of Medicine. I. Library Quarterly, 28(1), 1–17&lt;/ref&gt;

===European documentation===

The discipline of ''[[documentation science]]'', which marks the earliest theoretical foundations of modern information science, emerged in the late part of the 19th century in Europe together with several more scientific indexes whose purpose was to organize scholarly literature. Many information science historians cite [[Paul Otlet]] and [[Henri La Fontaine]] as the fathers of information science with the founding of the International Institute of Bibliography (IIB) in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;Rayward, W. B. (1994). International federation for information and documentation. In W. A. Wiegand, &amp; D. G. David Jr. (Eds.), The encyclopedia of library history (pp. 290–294). New York: Garland Publishing, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; A second generation of European Documentalists emerged after the [[Second World War]], most notably [[Suzanne Briet]].&lt;ref&gt;Maack, Mary Niles.(2004). The Lady and the Antelope: Suzanne Briet’s Contribution to the French Documentation Movement.” ''Library Trends'' 52, no. 4 (2004): 719–47.&lt;/ref&gt; However, "information science" as a term is not popularly used in academia until sometime in the latter part of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Day 2001, p7"&gt;Day, Ronald. ''Modern Invention of Information''. Carbondale, Il.: Southern Illinois University Press, 2001: 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Documentalists emphasized the utilitarian integration of technology and technique toward specific social goals. According to Ronald Day, "As an organized system of techniques and technologies, documentation was understood as a player in the historical development of global organization in modernity – indeed, a major player inasmuch as that organization was dependent on the organization and transmission of information."{{r|Day 2001, p7}} Otlet and Lafontaine (who won the [[Nobel Prize]] in 1913) not only envisioned later technical innovations but also projected a global vision for information and [[information technologies]] that speaks directly to postwar visions of a global "information society". Otlet and Lafontaine established numerous organizations dedicated to standardization, bibliography, international associations, and consequently, international cooperation. These organizations were fundamental for ensuring international production in commerce, information, communication and modern economic development, and they later found their global form in such institutions as the [[League of Nations]] and the [[United Nations]]. Otlet designed the [[Universal Decimal Classification]], based on [[Melville Dewey]]'s decimal classification system.{{r|Day 2001, p7}}

Although he lived decades before computers and networks emerged, what he discussed prefigured what ultimately became the [[World Wide Web]]. His vision of a great network of [[knowledge]] focused on [[document]]s and included the notions of [[hyperlink]]s, [[Search engine (computing)|search engines]], remote access, and [[social network]]s.

Otlet not only imagined that all the world's knowledge should be interlinked and made available remotely to anyone, but he also proceeded to build a structured document collection. This collection involved standardized paper sheets and cards filed in custom-designed cabinets according to a hierarchical index (which culled information worldwide from diverse sources) and a commercial information retrieval service (which answered written requests by copying relevant information from index cards). Users of this service were even warned if their query was likely to produce more than 50 results per search.&lt;ref name="Day 2001, p7" /&gt;
By 1937 documentation had formally been institutionalized, as evidenced by the founding of the American Documentation Institute (ADI), later called the [[American Society for Information Science and Technology]].

===Transition to modern information science===
[[File:Vannevar Bush portrait.jpg|thumb|[[Vannevar Bush]], a famous information scientist, {{circa|1940}}–1944]]
With the 1950s came increasing awareness of the potential of automatic devices for literature searching and information storage and retrieval. As these concepts grew in magnitude and potential, so did the variety of information science interests. By the 1960s and 70s, there was a move from batch processing to online modes, from mainframe to mini and microcomputers. Additionally, traditional boundaries among disciplines began to fade and many information science scholars joined with other programs. They further made themselves multidisciplinary by incorporating disciplines in the sciences, humanities and social sciences, as well as other professional programs, such as [[law]] and [[medicine]] in their curriculum.

Among the individuals who had distinct opportunities to facilitate interdisciplinary activity targeted at scientific communication was [[Foster E. Mohrhardt]], director of the [[National Agricultural Library]] from 1954 to 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Cragin, Melissa H. 2004. “Foster Mohrhardt: Connecting the Traditional World of Libraries and the Emerging World of Information Science.” ''Library Trends'' 52 (4): 833–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1980s, large databases, such as Grateful Med at the [[National Library of Medicine]], and user-oriented services such as [[Dialog (online database)|Dialog]] and [[Compuserve]], were for the first time accessible by individuals from their personal computers. The 1980s also saw the emergence of numerous [[special interest groups]] to respond to the changes. By the end of the decade, special interest groups were available involving non-print media, social sciences, energy and the environment, and community information systems. Today, information science largely examines technical bases, social consequences, and theoretical understanding of online databases, widespread use of databases in government, industry, and education, and the development of the Internet and World Wide Web.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asis.org/history.html |title=ASIST History |publisher=Asis.org |date=1968-01-01 |access-date=2011-05-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018105558/http://asis.org/history.html |archive-date=2012-10-18 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Information dissemination in the 21st century ==

===Changing definition===
[[Dissemination]] has historically been interpreted as unilateral communication of information. With the advent of the [[internet]], and the explosion in popularity of [[online communities]], [[social media]] has changed the information landscape in many respects, and creates both new modes of communication and new types of information",&lt;ref name=embedded&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miller | first1 = R | year = 2012 | title = Social media, authentic learning and embedded librarianship: a case study of dietetics students | journal = Journal of Information Literacy | volume = 6 | issue = 2| pages = 97–109 | doi=10.11645/6.2.1718| doi-access = free | hdl = 10919/19080 | hdl-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; changing the interpretation of the definition of dissemination. The nature of social networks allows for faster diffusion of information than through organizational sources.&lt;ref name=diffusion&gt;Zhang, B., Semenov, A., Vos, M. and Veijlainen, J. (2014). Understanding fast diffusion of information in the social media environment: A comparison of two cases. In ''ICC 2014 Conference Proceedings'', 522–533&lt;/ref&gt; The internet has changed the way we view, use, create, and store information; now it is time to re-evaluate the way we share and spread it.

===Impact of social media on people and industry===

Social media networks provide an open information environment for the mass of people who have limited time or access to traditional outlets of information diffusion,&lt;ref name=diffusion /&gt; this is an "increasingly mobile and social world [that] demands...new types of information skills".&lt;ref name=embedded /&gt; Social media integration as an access point is a very useful and mutually beneficial tool for users and providers. All major news providers have visibility and an access point through networks such as [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] maximizing their breadth of audience. Through social media people are directed to, or provided with, information by people they know. The ability to "share, like, and comment on...content"&lt;ref name=facebook&gt;Thompson, M. (2012). Share This. ''EContent''. 14–19&lt;/ref&gt; increases the reach farther and wider than traditional methods. People like to interact with information, they enjoy including the people they know in their circle of knowledge. Sharing through social media has become so influential that publishers must "play nice" if they desire to succeed. Although, it is often mutually beneficial for publishers and Facebook to "share, promote and uncover new content"&lt;ref name=facebook /&gt; to improve both user base experiences. The impact of popular opinion can spread in unimaginable ways. Social media allows interaction through simple to learn and access tools; ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' offers an app through Facebook, and ''[[The Washington Post]]'' goes a step further and offers an independent social app that was downloaded by 19.5 million users in six months,&lt;ref name=facebook /&gt; proving how interested people are in the new way of being provided information.

===Social media's power to facilitate topics===

The connections and networks sustained through social media help information providers learn what is important to people. The connections people have throughout the world enable the exchange of information at an unprecedented rate. It is for this reason that these networks have been realized for the potential they provide. "Most news media monitor Twitter for breaking news",&lt;ref name=diffusion /&gt; as well as news anchors frequently request the audience to tweet pictures of events.&lt;ref name=facebook /&gt; The users and viewers of the shared information have earned "opinion-making and agenda-setting power"&lt;ref name=diffusion /&gt; This channel has been recognized for the usefulness of providing targeted information based on public demand.

== Research sectors and applications ==
[[File:Getting_to_Philosophy_graph_of_Wikipedia_articles_by_Pine.png|thumb|This graph shows links between [[Wikipedia]] articles. Information science includes studying how topics relate to each other, and how readers relate concepts to each other.]]
The following areas are some of those that information science investigates and develops.

===Information access===
Information access is an area of research at the intersection of [[Informatics]], Information Science, [[Information Security]], [[Language Technology]], and [[Computer Science]]. The objectives of information access research are to automate the processing of large and unwieldy amounts of information and to simplify users' access to it. What about assigning privileges and restricting access to unauthorized users? The extent of access should be defined in the level of clearance granted for the information. Applicable technologies include [[information retrieval]], [[text mining]], [[text editing]], [[machine translation]], and [[text categorisation]]. In discussion, information access is often defined as concerning the insurance of free and closed or public access to information and is brought up in discussions on [[copyright]], [[patent law]], and [[public domain]]. Public libraries need resources to provide knowledge of information assurance.

===Information architecture===
{{Main|Information architecture}}

Information architecture (IA) is the art and science of organizing and labelling [[website]]s, [[intranet]]s, [[online communities]] and software to support usability.&lt;ref&gt;'What is IA?' Information Architecture Institute. [http://www.iainstitute.org/documents/learn/What_is_IA.pdf IAinstitute.org] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070726070358/http://iainstitute.org/documents/learn/What_is_IA.pdf |date=2007-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an emerging discipline and ''community of practice'' focused on bringing together principles of [[design]] and [[architecture]] to the ''digital landscape''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Morville | first1 = Peter | last2 = Rosenfeld | first2 = Louis | title = Information Architecture for the World Wide Web | publisher = O'Reilly Media, Inc | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-596-52734-1 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/informationarchi00morv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically it involves a [[Scientific modelling|model]] or [[concept]] of [[information]] which is used and applied to activities that require explicit details of complex [[information system]]s. These activities include [[library]] systems and [[database]] development.

===Information management===
{{Main|Information management}}

Information management (IM) is the collection and management of information from one or more sources and the distribution of that information to one or more audiences. This sometimes involves those who have a stake in, or a right to that information. Management means the organization of and control over the structure, processing and delivery of information. Throughout the 1970s this was largely limited to files, file maintenance, and the life cycle management of paper-based files, other media and records. With the proliferation of information technology starting in the 1970s, the job of information management took on a new light and also began to include the field of data maintenance.

===Information retrieval===
{{Main|Information retrieval}}

Information retrieval (IR) is the area of study concerned with searching for documents, for [[information]] within documents, and for [[metadata]] about documents, as well as that of searching [[structured storage]], [[relational database]]s, and the [[World Wide Web]]. Automated information retrieval systems are used to reduce what has been called "[[information overload]]". Many universities and [[public libraries]] use IR systems to provide access to books, journals and other documents. [[Web search engine]]s are the most visible [[Information retrieval applications|IR applications]].

An information retrieval process begins when a user enters a [[query string|query]] into the system. Queries are formal statements of [[information need]]s, for example search strings in web search engines. In information retrieval a query does not uniquely identify a single object in the collection. Instead, several objects may match the query, perhaps with different degrees of [[relevancy]].

An object is an entity that is represented by information in a [[database]]. User queries are matched against the database information. Depending on the [[Information retrieval applications|application]] the data objects may be, for example, text documents, images,&lt;ref name=goodron2000&gt;{{cite journal |first=Abby A. |last=Goodrum |title=Image Information Retrieval: An Overview of Current Research |journal=Informing Science |volume=3 |year=2000 |issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; audio,&lt;ref name=Foote99&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jonathan |last=Foote |title=An overview of audio information retrieval |journal=Multimedia Systems |year=1999 |doi=10.1007/s005300050106 |volume=7 |pages=2–10 |s2cid=2000641 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[mind maps]]&lt;ref name=Beel2009&gt;{{cite conference |first1=Jöran |last1=Beel |first2=Bela |last2=Gipp |first3=Jan-Olaf |last3=Stiller |title=Information Retrieval On Mind Maps – What Could It Be Good For? |url=http://www.sciplore.org/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/beel09f.pdf|conference=Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Collaborative Computing: Networking, Applications and Worksharing (CollaborateCom'09) |year=2009 |publisher=IEEE |place=Washington, DC }}&lt;/ref&gt; or videos. Often the documents themselves are not kept or stored directly in the IR system, but are instead represented in the system by document surrogates or metadata.

Most IR systems compute a numeric score on how well each object in the database match the query, and rank the objects according to this value. The top ranking objects are then shown to the user. The process may then be iterated if the user wishes to refine the query.&lt;ref name="Frakes1992"&gt;{{cite book |last=Frakes |first=William B. |title=Information Retrieval Data Structures &amp; Algorithms |publisher=Prentice-Hall, Inc. |year=1992 |isbn=978-0-13-463837-9 |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/13742235/Information-Retrieval-Data-Structures-Algorithms-William-B-Frakes |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928060217/http://www.scribd.com/doc/13742235/Information-Retrieval-Data-Structures-Algorithms-William-B-Frakes |archive-date=2013-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Information seeking===
{{Main|Information seeking}}

Information seeking is the process or activity of attempting to obtain information in both human and technological contexts. Information seeking is related to, but different from, information retrieval (IR).

Much library and information science (LIS) research has focused on the information-seeking practices of practitioners within various fields of professional work. Studies have been carried out into the information-seeking behaviors of librarians,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = C. M. | last2 = Ortega | first2 = L. | year = 2007 | title = Information seeking behaviour of physical science librarians: Does research inform practice | url = http://crl.acrl.org/content/66/3/231.short | journal = College &amp; Research Libraries | volume = 66 | issue = 3 | pages = 231–247 | doi = 10.5860/crl.66.3.231 | doi-access = free | access-date = 2012-04-29 | archive-date = 2014-06-12 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140612112147/http://crl.acrl.org/content/66/3/231.short | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt; academics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hemminger | first1 = B.

Much of this research has drawn on the work done by Leckie, Pettigrew (now Fisher) and Sylvain, who in 1996 conducted an extensive review of the LIS literature (as well as the literature of other academic fields) on professionals' information seeking. The authors proposed an analytic model of professionals' information seeking behaviour, intended to be generalizable across the professions, thus providing a platform for future research in the area. The model was intended to "prompt new insights... and give rise to more refined and applicable theories of information seeking" {{harv|Leckie|Pettigrew|Sylvain|1996|p=188}}. The model has been adapted by {{harvtxt|Wilkinson|2001}} who proposes a model of the information seeking of lawyers. Recent studies in this topic address the concept of information-gathering that "provides a broader perspective that adheres better to professionals' work-related reality and desired skills."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Solomon |first1=Yosef |last2=Bronstein |first2=Jenny |date=18 February 2021 |title=The information-gathering practice of liberal professionals in a workplace setting: More than just seeking information |journal=Journal of Librarianship and Information Science |publisher=SAGE |volume=54 |issue=1 |pages=54–68 |issn=0961-0006 |doi=10.1177/0961000621992810 |s2cid = 233978764}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{harv|Solomon|Bronstein|2021}}.

===Information society===
{{Main|Information society}}

An information society is a [[society]] where the creation, distribution, diffusion, uses, integration and manipulation of [[information]] is a significant economic, political, and cultural activity. The aim of an information society is to gain competitive advantage internationally, through using [[IT]] in a creative and productive way.  The [[knowledge economy]] is its economic counterpart, whereby wealth is created through the economic exploitation of understanding. People who have the means to partake in this form of society are sometimes called [[digital citizens]].

Basically, an information society is the means of getting information from one place to another {{harv|Wark|1997|p=22}}. As technology has become more advanced over time so too has the way we have adapted in sharing this information with each other.

Information society theory discusses the role of information and information technology in society, the question of which key concepts should be used for characterizing contemporary society, and how to define such concepts. It has become a specific branch of contemporary sociology.

=== Knowledge representation and reasoning ===
{{main|Knowledge representation and reasoning}}

Knowledge representation (KR) is an area of [[artificial intelligence]] research aimed at representing knowledge in symbols to facilitate [[inferencing]] from those [[knowledge]] elements, creating new elements of knowledge. The KR can be made to be independent of the underlying knowledge model or knowledge base system (KBS) such as a [[semantic network]].&lt;ref name="martin" &gt;[http://www.webkb.org/doc/papers/iccs02/iswc02.pdf "Knowledge representation in RDF/XML, KIF, Frame-CG and Formalized-English"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326091831/http://www.webkb.org/doc/papers/iccs02/iswc02.pdf |date=2012-03-26 }}, Philippe Martin, Distributed System Technology Centre, QLD, Australia, July 15–19, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Knowledge Representation (KR) research involves analysis of how to reason accurately and effectively and how best to use a set of symbols to represent a set of facts within a knowledge domain. A symbol vocabulary and a system of logic are combined to enable [[inference]]s about elements in the KR to create new KR sentences. Logic is used to supply formal [[semantics]] of how reasoning functions should be applied to the symbols in the KR system. Logic is also used to define how operators can process and reshape the knowledge. Examples of operators and operations include, negation, conjunction, adverbs, adjectives, quantifiers and modal operators. The logic is interpretation theory. These elements—symbols, operators, and interpretation theory—are what give sequences of symbols meaning within a KR.

An '''information society''' is a [[society]] or [[subculture]] where the usage, [[Content creation|creation]], [[information distribution|distribution]], manipulation and [[information integration|integration]] of [[information]] is a significant activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Soll, Jacob, 1968-|title=The information master : Jean-Baptiste Colbert's secret state intelligence system|date=2009|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=978-0-472-02526-8|oclc=643805520}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Duff |first1=Alistair S. |title=Information Society |journal=International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences (Second Edition) |date=2015 |pages=83–89 |doi=10.1016/B978-0-08-097086-8.95017-7 |isbn=978-0-08-097087-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its main drivers are [[information and communication technologies]], which have resulted in rapid growth of a variety of forms of information. Proponents of this theory posit that these technologies are impacting most important forms of social organization, including [[education]], [[economy]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Hilbert|Hilbert, M.]] (2023).

Mossberger as “Those who use the Internet regularly and effectively”. This is one of many dozen internet terms that have been identified to suggest that humans are entering a new and different phase of society.&lt;ref name="Beniger 1986"&gt;{{cite book |title= The Control Revolution: Technological and Economic Origins of the Information Society |last= Beniger |first=James R. |author-link= James R.

Some of the markers of this steady change may be technological, economic, occupational, spatial, cultural, or a combination of all of these.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |last=Webster |first=Frank |title=Theories of the Information Society |date=2002 |publisher=Routledge |location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Information society is seen as a successor to [[industrial society]]. Closely related concepts are the [[post-industrial society]] ([[post-fordism]]), [[postmodernity|post-modern]] society, computer society and [[knowledge society]], telematic society,  [[The Society of the Spectacle|society of the spectacle]] ([[postmodernism]]), [[Information Revolution]] and [[Information Age]], [[network society]] ([[Manuel Castells]]) or even [[liquid modernity]].

==Definition==
There is currently no universally accepted concept of what exactly can be defined as an information society and what shall not be included in the term. Most theoreticians agree that a transformation can be seen as started somewhere between the 1970s, the early 1990s transformations of the [[Eastern Bloc]] nations [[Post-communism|from socialist to capitalist economies]] and the 2000s period that formed most of today's net principles and currently as is changing the way societies work fundamentally. Information technology goes beyond the [[internet]], as the principles of internet design and usage influence other areas, and there are discussions about how big the influence of specific media or specific modes of production really is. [[Frank Webster (sociologist)|Frank Webster]] notes five major types of information that can be used to define information society: technological, economic, occupational, spatial and cultural.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to Webster, the character of information has transformed the way that we live today. How we conduct ourselves centers around theoretical knowledge and information.&lt;ref&gt;Webster, F. (2006). Chapter 2: What is an information society? In ''Theories of the Information Society'', 3rd ed. (pp. 15-31). New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kasiwulaya and Gomo (Makerere University) allude{{Where|date=February 2018}}&lt;!-- Exactly where do they make this allusion (if allusions are even worth bothering with)? --&gt;{{Dubious|date=February 2018}}&lt;!-- If they don't dare say it but merely allude to it, why are we bothering with this? --&gt; that information societies are those that have intensified their use of IT for economic, social, cultural and political transformation. In 2005, governments reaffirmed their dedication to the foundations of the Information
Society in the [[Tunis Commitment]] and outlined the basis for implementation and follow-up in the Tunis Agenda for the Information Society. In particular, the Tunis Agenda addresses the issues of financing of ICTs for development and Internet governance that could not be resolved in the first phase.

Some people, such as [[Antonio Negri]], characterize the information society as one in which people do immaterial labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Magic Lantern Empire: Reflections on Colonialism and Society|date=2017-12-31|work=Magic Lantern Empire|pages=148–160|publisher=Cornell University Press|doi=10.7591/9780801468230-009|isbn=978-0-8014-6823-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this, they appear to refer to the production of knowledge or cultural artifacts. One problem with this model is that it ignores the material and essentially industrial basis of the society. However it does point to a problem for workers, namely how many creative people does this society need to function?  For example, it may be that you only need a few star performers, rather than a plethora of non-celebrities, as the work of those performers can be easily distributed, forcing all secondary players to the bottom of the market. It ''is'' now common for publishers to promote only their best selling authors and to try to avoid the rest—even if they still sell steadily. Films are becoming more and more judged, in terms of distribution, by their first weekend's performance, in many cases cutting out opportunity for word-of-mouth development.

[[Michael Buckland]] characterizes information in society in his book ''Information and Society.'' Buckland expresses the idea that information can be interpreted differently from person to person based on that individual's experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buckland|first1=Michael|title=Information in Society|date=March 3, 2017|publisher=MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Considering that metaphors and technologies of information move forward in a reciprocal relationship, we can describe some societies (especially the [[Japanese society]]) as an information society because we think of it as such.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Boyle (academic)|James Boyle]], 1996, 6{{Vague|date=February 2018}}&lt;!-- WHAT, published by Boyle in 1996? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Kasiwulaya and Walter, Makerere University. Makerere University Press.{{Vague|date=February 2018}}&lt;!-- WHAT is this? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The word information may be interpreted in many different ways. According to Buckland in ''Information and Society'', most of the meanings fall into three categories of human knowledge: information as knowledge, information as a process, and information as a thing.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Information and Society|last=Buckland|first=Michael|publisher=MIT Press|year=2017|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, the Information Society refers to the social importance given to communication and information in today's society, where social, economic and cultural relations are involved.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Polo Roca |first=Andoni |date=2020-06-29 |title=Information Society, Digital Society, Control Society |url=http://inguruak.eus/index.php/inguruak/article/view/68-2020-art05 |journal=Basque Journal of Sociology and Political Science |issue=68 |page=53 |doi=10.18543/inguruak-68-2020-art05 |s2cid=225651269 |issn=0214-7912|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Information Society, the process of capturing, processing and communicating information is the main element that characterizes it. Thus, in this type of society, the vast majority of it will be dedicated to the provision of services and said services will consist of the processing, distribution or use of information.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The growth of the amount of technologically mediated information has been quantified in different ways, including society's technological capacity to store information, to communicate information, and to compute information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Hilbert|first1=M.|last2=Lopez|first2=P.|date=2011-02-10|title=The World's Technological Capacity to Store, Communicate, and Compute Information|journal=Science|volume=332|issue=6025|pages=60–65|doi=10.1126/science.1200970|pmid=21310967|bibcode=2011Sci...332...60H|s2cid=206531385|issn=0036-8075|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that, the world's technological capacity to store information grew from 2.6 (optimally compressed) [[exabytes]] in 1986, which is the informational equivalent to less than one 730-MB [[CD-ROM]] per person in 1986 (539 MB per person), to 295 (optimally compressed) [[exabytes]] in 2007.&lt;ref name="HilbertLopez2011"&gt;[https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1200970 "The World’s Technological Capacity to Store, Communicate, and Compute Information"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727161911/http://www.sciencemag.org/content/332/6025/60 |date=2013-07-27 }}, Martin Hilbert and Priscila López (2011), [[Science (journal)|Science]], 332(6025), 60-65; free access to the article through here: martinhilbert.net/WorldInfoCapacity.html&lt;/ref&gt; This is the informational equivalent of 60 [[CD-ROM]] per person in 2007&lt;ref name="Hilbertvideo2011"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIKPjOuwqHo |title="video animation on The World's Technological Capacity to Store, Communicate, and Compute Information from 1986 to 2010 |website=[[YouTube]] |date=11 June 2011 |access-date=2016-11-29 |archive-date=2013-02-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130221144621/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIKPjOuwqHo |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; and represents a sustained annual growth rate of some 25%. The world's combined technological capacity to receive information through one-way [[broadcast]] networks was the informational equivalent of 174 newspapers per person per day in 2007.&lt;ref name="HilbertLopez2011"/&gt;

The world's combined effective capacity to exchange information through two-way [[telecommunications network]]s was 281 [[petabytes]] of (optimally compressed) information in 1986, 471 [[petabytes]] in 1993, 2.2 (optimally compressed) [[exabytes]] in 2000, and 65 (optimally compressed) [[exabytes]] in 2007, which is the informational equivalent of 6 newspapers per person per day in 2007.&lt;ref name="Hilbertvideo2011"/&gt; The world's technological capacity to compute information with humanly guided general-purpose computers grew from 3.0 × 10^8 MIPS in 1986, to 6.4 x 10^12 MIPS in 2007, experiencing the fastest growth rate of over 60% per year during the last two decades.&lt;ref name="HilbertLopez2011"/&gt;

[[James R. Beniger]] describes the necessity of information in modern society in the following way: “The need for sharply increased control that resulted from the industrialization of material processes through application of inanimate sources of energy probably accounts for the rapid development of automatic feedback technology in the early industrial period (1740-1830)” (p.&amp;nbsp;174)
“Even with enhanced feedback control, industry could not have developed without the enhanced means to process matter and energy, not only as inputs of the raw materials of production but also as outputs distributed to final consumption.”(p.&amp;nbsp;175)&lt;ref name="Beniger 1986"/&gt;

==Development of the information society model==
[[File:Clark's Sector Model.png|right|thumb|450px|[[Colin Clark (economist)|Colin Clark]]'s sector model of an economy undergoing technological change. In later stages, the [[Quaternary sector of the economy]] grows.]]
One of the first people to develop the concept of the information society was the economist [[Fritz Machlup]]. In 1933, Fritz Machlup began studying the effect of patents on research. His work culminated in the study ''The production and distribution of knowledge in the United States'' in 1962. This book was widely regarded&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc=227258 | date=1983 | last1=Crawford | first1=S. | title=The origin and development of a concept: The information society | journal=Bulletin of the Medical Library Association | volume=71 | issue=4 | pages=380–385 | pmid=6652297 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was eventually translated into [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. The Japanese have also studied the information society (or ''jōhōka shakai'', [[:ja:情報化社会|情報化社会]]).

The issue of technologies and their role in contemporary society have been discussed in the scientific literature using a range of labels and concepts. This section introduces some of them. Ideas of a knowledge or [[information economy]], [[post-industrial society]], [[postmodernism|postmodern]] society, [[network society]], the [[information revolution]], informational capitalism, network capitalism, and the like, have been debated over the last several decades.

Fritz Machlup (1962) introduced the concept of the [[knowledge economy|knowledge industry]]. He began studying the effects of patents on research before distinguishing five sectors of the knowledge sector: education, research and development, mass media, information technologies, information services. Based on this categorization he calculated that in 1959 29% per cent of the GNP in the USA had been produced in knowledge industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Intellectual Capital, Knowledge Management and Organizational Learning|last=Rooney|first=Jim|publisher=Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited|year=2014|isbn=978-1-910309-71-1|location=UK|pages=261}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Machlup|first1=Fritz|title=The Production and Distribution of Knowledge in the United States|url=https://archive.org/details/productiondistri00mach|date=1962|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|reason=What's the year referring to?|date=November 2009}}

=== Economic transition ===
[[Peter Drucker]] has argued that there is a transition from an economy based on material goods to one based on knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Drucker]] (1969) ''The Age of Discontinuity''. London: Heinemann&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marc Porat]] distinguishes a primary (information goods and services that are directly used in the production, distribution or processing of information) and a secondary sector (information services produced for internal consumption by government and non-information firms) of the information economy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marc Porat]] (1977) The Information Economy. Washington, DC: US Department of Commerce&lt;/ref&gt;

Porat uses the total value added by the primary and secondary information sector to the GNP as an indicator for the information economy. The [[OECD]] has employed Porat's definition for calculating the share of the information economy in the total economy (e.g. OECD 1981, 1986). Based on such indicators, the information society has been defined as a society where more than half of the GNP is produced and more than half of the employees are active in the information economy.&lt;ref name=deutsch1983&gt;Karl Deutsch (1983) Soziale und politische Aspekte der Informationsgesellschaft. In: Philipp Sonntag (Ed.) (1983) Die Zukunft der Informationsgesellschaft. Frankfurt/Main: Haag &amp; Herchen. pp. 68-88&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Daniel Bell]] the number of employees producing services and information is an indicator for the informational character of a society. "A post-industrial society is based on services. (…) What counts is not raw muscle power, or energy, but information. (…) A post industrial society is one in which the majority of those employed are not involved in the production of tangible goods".&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Bell]] (1976) The Coming of Post-Industrial Society. New York: Basic Books, 127, 348&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alain Touraine]] already spoke in 1971 of the post-industrial society. "The passage to postindustrial society takes place when investment results in the production of symbolic goods that modify values, needs, representations, far more than in the production of material goods or even of 'services'. Industrial society had transformed the means of production: post-industrial society changes the ends of production, that is, culture. (…) The decisive point here is that in postindustrial society all of the economic system is the object of intervention of society upon itself. That is why we can call it the programmed society, because this phrase captures its capacity to create models of management, production, organization, distribution, and consumption, so that such a society appears, at all its functional levels, as the product of an action exercised by the society itself, and not as the outcome of natural laws or cultural specificities" (Touraine 1988: 104). In the programmed society also the area of cultural reproduction including aspects such as information, consumption, health, research, education would be industrialized. That modern society is increasing its capacity to act upon itself means for Touraine that society is reinvesting ever larger parts of production and so produces and transforms itself. This makes Touraine's concept substantially different from that of Daniel Bell who focused on the capacity to process and generate information for efficient society functioning.

[[Jean-François Lyotard]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean-François Lyotard]] (1984) ''The Postmodern Condition''. Manchester: Manchester University Press, 5&lt;/ref&gt; has argued that "knowledge has become the {{sic|principle}} force of production over the last few decades". Knowledge would be transformed into a commodity. Lyotard says that postindustrial society makes knowledge accessible to the layman because knowledge and information technologies would diffuse into society and break up Grand Narratives of centralized structures and groups. Lyotard denotes these changing circumstances as postmodern condition or postmodern society.

Similarly to Bell, Peter Otto and Philipp Sonntag (1985) say that an information society is a society where the majority of employees work in information jobs, i.e. they have to deal more with information, signals, symbols, and images than with energy and matter. [[Radovan Richta]] (1977) argues that society has been transformed into a scientific civilization based on services, education, and creative activities. This transformation would be the result of a scientific-technological transformation based on technological progress and the increasing importance of computer technology. Science and technology would become immediate forces of production (Aristovnik 2014: 55).

[[Nico Stehr]] (1994, 2002a, b) says that in the knowledge society a majority of jobs involves working with knowledge. "Contemporary society may be described as a knowledge society based on the extensive penetration of all its spheres of life and institutions by scientific and technological knowledge" (Stehr 2002b: 18). For Stehr, knowledge is a capacity for social action. Science would become an immediate productive force, knowledge would no longer be primarily embodied in machines, but already appropriated nature that represents knowledge would be rearranged according to certain designs and programs (Ibid.: 41-46). For Stehr, the economy of a knowledge society is largely driven not by material inputs, but by symbolic or knowledge-based inputs (Ibid.: 67), there would be a large number of professions that involve working with knowledge, and a declining number of jobs that demand low cognitive skills as well as in manufacturing (Stehr 2002a).

Also [[Alvin Toffler]] argues that knowledge is the central resource in the economy of the information society: "In a Third Wave economy, the central resource – a single word broadly encompassing data, information, images, symbols, culture, ideology, and values –  is actionable knowledge" (Dyson/Gilder/Keyworth/Toffler 1994).

At the end of the twentieth century, the concept of the [[network society]] gained importance in information society theory. For [[Manuel Castells]], network logic is besides information, pervasiveness, flexibility, and convergence a central feature of the information technology paradigm (2000a: 69ff). "One of the key features of informational society is the networking logic of its basic structure, which explains the use of the concept of 'network society'" (Castells 2000: 21). "As an historical trend, dominant functions and processes in the Information Age are increasingly organized around networks. Networks constitute the new social morphology of our societies, and the diffusion of networking logic substantially modifies the operation and outcomes in processes of production, experience, power, and culture" (Castells 2000: 500). For Castells the network society is the result of informationalism, a new technological paradigm.

[[Jan Van Dijk]] (2006) defines the network society as a "social formation with an infrastructure of social and media networks enabling its prime mode of organization at all levels (individual, group/organizational and societal). Increasingly, these networks link all units or parts of this formation (individuals, groups and organizations)" (Van Dijk 2006: 20). For Van Dijk networks have become the nervous system of society, whereas Castells links the concept of the network society to capitalist transformation, Van Dijk sees it as the logical result of the increasing widening and thickening of networks in nature and society. [[Darin Barney]] uses the term for characterizing societies that exhibit two fundamental characteristics: "The first is the presence in those societies of sophisticated – almost exclusively digital – technologies of networked communication and information management/distribution, technologies which form the basic infrastructure mediating an increasing array of social, political and economic practices. (…) The second, arguably more intriguing, characteristic of network societies is the reproduction and institutionalization throughout (and between) those societies of networks as the basic form of human organization and relationship across a wide range of social, political and economic configurations and associations".&lt;ref&gt;[[Darin Barney]] (2003) The Network Society. Cambridge: Polity, 25sq&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Critiques ===
The major critique of concepts such as information society, postmodern society, knowledge society, network society,  postindustrial society, etc. that has mainly been voiced by critical scholars is that they create the impression that we have entered a completely new type of society. "If there is just more information then it is hard to understand why anyone should suggest that we have before us something radically new" (Webster 2002a: 259). Critics such as [[Frank Webster (sociologist)|Frank Webster]] argue that these approaches stress discontinuity, as if contemporary society had nothing in common with society as it was 100 or 150 years ago. Such assumptions would have ideological character because they would fit with the view that we can do nothing about change and have to adapt to existing political realities (kasiwulaya 2002b: 267).

These critics argue that contemporary society first of all is still a capitalist society oriented towards accumulating economic, political, and [[cultural capital]]. They acknowledge that information society theories stress some important new qualities of society (notably globalization and informatization), but charge that they fail to show that these are attributes of overall capitalist structures. Critics such as Webster insist on the continuities that characterise change. In this way Webster distinguishes between different epochs of capitalism: laissez-faire capitalism of the 19th century, [[corporate capitalism]] in the 20th century, and informational capitalism for the 21st century (kasiwulaya 2006).

For describing contemporary society based on a new dialectic of continuity and discontinuity, other critical scholars have suggested several terms like:
* transnational network capitalism, transnational informational capitalism ([[Christian Fuchs (sociologist)|Christian Fuchs]] 2008, 2007): "Computer networks are the technological foundation that has allowed the emergence of global network capitalism, that is, regimes of accumulation, regulation, and discipline that are helping to increasingly base the accumulation of economic, political, and cultural capital on transnational network organizations that make use of cyberspace and other new technologies for global coordination and communication. [...] The need to find new strategies for executing corporate and political domination has resulted in a restructuration of capitalism that is characterized by the emergence of transnational, networked spaces in the economic, political, and cultural system and has been mediated by cyberspace as a tool of global coordination and communication. Economic, political, and cultural space have been restructured; they have become more fluid and dynamic, have enlarged their borders to a transnational scale, and handle the inclusion and exclusion of nodes in flexible ways. These networks are complex due to the high number of nodes (individuals, enterprises, teams, political actors, etc.) that can be involved and the high speed at which a high number of resources is produced and transported within them. But global network capitalism is based on structural inequalities; it is made up of segmented spaces in which central hubs (transnational corporations, certain political actors, regions, countries, Western lifestyles, and worldviews) centralize the production, control, and flows of economic, political, and cultural capital (property, power, definition capacities). This segmentation is an expression of the overall competitive character of contemporary society." (Fuchs 2008: 110+119).
* digital capitalism (Schiller 2000, cf. also [[Peter Glotz]]):&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Glotz]] (1999) Die beschleunigte Gesellschaft. Kulturkämpfe im digitalen Kapitalismus. München: Kindler.&lt;/ref&gt; "networks are directly generalizing the social and cultural range of the capitalist economy as never before" (Schiller 2000: xiv)
* virtual capitalism: the "combination of marketing and the new information technology will enable certain firms to obtain higher profit margins and larger market shares, and will thereby promote greater concentration and centralization of capital" (Dawson/[[John Bellamy Foster]] 1998: 63sq),
* high-tech capitalism&lt;ref&gt;[[Wolfgang Fritz Haug]] (2003) High-Tech-Kapitalismus. Hamburg: Argument.&lt;/ref&gt; or informatic capitalism (Fitzpatrick 2002) – to focus on the computer as a guiding technology that has transformed the productive forces of capitalism and has enabled a globalized economy.

Other scholars prefer to speak of information capitalism (Morris-Suzuki 1997) or informational capitalism ([[Manuel Castells]] 2000, [[Christian Fuchs (sociologist)|Christian Fuchs]] 2005, Schmiede 2006a, b). Manuel Castells sees informationalism as a new technological paradigm (he speaks of a mode of development) characterized by "information generation, processing, and transmission" that have become "the fundamental sources of productivity and power" (Castells 2000: 21). The "most decisive historical factor accelerating, channelling and shaping the information technology paradigm, and inducing its associated social forms, was/is the process of capitalist restructuring undertaken since the 1980s, so that the new techno-economic system can be adequately characterized as informational capitalism" (Castells 2000: 18). Castells has added to theories of the information society the idea that in contemporary society dominant functions and processes are increasingly organized around networks that constitute the new social morphology of society (Castells 2000: 500). [[Nicholas Garnham]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Garnham]] (2004) Information Society Theory as Ideology. In: Frank Webster (Ed.) (2004) The Information Society Reader. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; is critical of Castells and argues that the latter's account is technologically determinist because Castells points out that his approach is based on a dialectic of technology and society in which technology embodies society and society uses technology (Castells 2000: 5sqq). But Castells also makes clear that the rise of a new "mode of development" is shaped by capitalist production, i.e. by society, which implies that technology isn't the only driving force of society.

[[Antonio Negri]] and [[Michael Hardt]] argue that contemporary society is an Empire that is characterized by a singular global logic of capitalist domination that is based on immaterial labour. With the concept of immaterial labour Negri and Hardt introduce ideas of information society discourse into their Marxist account of contemporary capitalism. Immaterial labour would be labour "that creates immaterial products, such as knowledge, information, communication, a relationship, or an emotional response" (Hardt/Negri 2005: 108; cf. also 2000: 280-303), or services, cultural products, knowledge (Hardt/Negri 2000: 290). There would be two forms: intellectual labour that produces ideas, symbols, codes, texts, linguistic figures, images, etc.; and [[affective labor|affective labour]] that produces and manipulates affects such as a feeling of ease, well-being, satisfaction, excitement, passion, joy, sadness, etc. (Ibid.).

Overall, neo-Marxist accounts of the information society have in common that they stress that knowledge, information technologies, and computer networks have played a role in the restructuration and globalization of capitalism and the emergence of a flexible regime of accumulation ([[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] 1989). They warn that new technologies are embedded into societal antagonisms that cause [[structural unemployment]], rising poverty, [[social exclusion]], the [[deregulation]] of the [[welfare state]] and of [[labour rights]], the lowering of wages, welfare, etc.

Concepts such as knowledge society, information society, network society, informational capitalism, postindustrial society, transnational network capitalism, postmodern society, etc. show that there is a vivid discussion in contemporary sociology on the character of contemporary society and the role that technologies, information, communication, and co-operation play in it.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Information society theory discusses the role of information and information technology in society, the question which key concepts shall be used for characterizing contemporary society, and how to define such concepts. It has become a specific branch of contemporary sociology.

==Second and third nature==
{{One source section|date=August 2017}}
Information society is the means of sending and receiving information from one place to another.{{sfn|Wark|1997|p=22}} As technology has advanced so too has the way people have adapted in sharing information with each other.

"Second nature" refers a group of experiences that get made over by culture.{{sfn|Wark|1997|p=23}} They then get remade into something else that can then take on a new meaning. As a society we transform this process so it becomes something natural to us, i.e. second nature. So, by following a particular pattern created by culture we are able to recognise how we use and move information in different ways. From sharing information via different time zones (such as talking online) to information ending up in a different location (sending a letter overseas) this has all become a habitual process that we as a society take for granted.{{sfn|Wark|1997|p=21}}

However, through the process of sharing information vectors have enabled us to spread information even further. Through the use of these vectors information is able to move and then separate from the initial things that enabled them to move.{{sfn|Wark|1997|p=24}} From here, something called "third nature" has developed. An extension of second nature, third nature is in control of second nature. It expands on what second nature is limited by. It has the ability to mould information in new and different ways. So, third nature is able to ‘speed up, proliferate, divide, mutate, and beam in on us from elsewhere.{{sfn|Wark|1997|p=25}} It aims to create a balance between the boundaries of space and time (see second nature). This can be seen through the telegraph, it was the first successful technology that could send and receive information faster than a human being could move an object.{{sfn|Wark|1997|p=26}} As a result different vectors of people have the ability to not only shape culture but create new possibilities that will ultimately shape society.

Therefore, through the use of second nature and third nature society is able to use and explore new vectors of possibility where information can be moulded to create new forms of interaction.{{sfn|Wark|1997|p=28}}

==Sociological uses==
[[File:Ayuntamiento, vistas panorámicas desde Toompea, Tallin, Estonia, 2012-08-05, DD 21.JPG|thumb|[[Estonia]], a small [[Baltic country]] in northern [[Europe]], is one of the most advanced digital societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | url= https://www.wired.co.uk/article/digital-estonia |title=Welcome to E-stonia, the world's most digitally advanced society |magazine= [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |access-date= 15 July 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In [[sociology]], '''''informational society''''' refers to a [[postmodernity|post-modern]] type of society. Theoreticians like [[Ulrich Beck]], [[Anthony Giddens]] and [[Manuel Castells]] argue that since the 1970s a transformation from [[industrial society]] to informational society has happened on a global scale.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leonid Grinin|Grinin, L.]] 2007. Periodization of History: A theoretic-mathematical analysis. In: [http://urss.ru/cgi-bin/db.pl?cp=&amp;page=Book&amp;id=53184&amp;lang=en&amp;blang=en&amp;list=1 ''History &amp; Mathematics''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206111250/http://urss.ru/cgi-bin/db.pl?cp=&amp;page=Book&amp;id=53184&amp;lang=en&amp;blang=en&amp;list=1 |date=2012-02-06 }}. Moscow: KomKniga/URSS. P.10-38. {{ISBN|978-5-484-01001-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[steam power]] was the technology standing behind industrial society, so [[information technology]] is seen as the catalyst for the changes in work organisation, societal structure and politics occurring in the late 20th century.

In the book ''[[Future Shock]]'', [[Alvin Toffler]] used the phrase '''super-industrial society''' to describe this type of society.  Other writers and thinkers have used terms like "[[post-industrial society]]" and "post-modern industrial society" with a similar meaning.

== Related terms ==
A number of terms in current use emphasize related but different aspects of the emerging global economic order. The Information Society intends to be the most encompassing in that an economy is a subset of a society. The [[Information Age]] is somewhat limiting, in that it refers to a 30-year period between the widespread use of computers and the [[knowledge economy]], rather than an emerging economic order. The knowledge era is about the nature of the content, not the socioeconomic processes by which it will be traded. The [[computer revolution]], and knowledge revolution refer to specific revolutionary transitions, rather than the end state towards which we are evolving. The [[Information Revolution]] relates with the well-known terms agricultural revolution and [[Industrial Revolution]].
* The [[information economy]] and the [[knowledge economy]] emphasize the [[Content (media and publishing)|content]] or [[intellectual property]] that is being traded through an information market or [[knowledge market]], respectively. [[Electronic commerce]] and [[electronic business]] emphasize the nature of transactions and running a business, respectively, using the [[Internet]] and [[World-Wide Web]]. The [[digital economy]] focuses on trading bits in [[cyberspace]] rather than atoms in physical space. The network economy stresses that businesses will work collectively in webs or as part of business ecosystems rather than as stand-alone units. [[Social networking]] refers to the process of collaboration on massive, global scales. The [[internet economy]] focuses on the nature of markets that are enabled by the Internet.
* Knowledge services and knowledge value put content into an economic context. Knowledge services integrates [[Knowledge management]], within a [[Knowledge organization]], that trades in a [[Knowledge market]]. In order for individuals to receive more knowledge, surveillance is used. This relates to the use of Drones as a tool in order to gather knowledge on other individuals. Although seemingly synonymous, each term conveys more than nuances or slightly different views of the same thing. Each term represents one attribute of the likely nature of economic activity in the emerging post-industrial society. Alternatively, the new economic order will incorporate all of the above plus other attributes that have not yet fully emerged.
* In connection with the development of the information society, [[information pollution]] appeared, which in turn evolved [[information ecology]] – associated with information [[hygiene]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240515256_Information_ecology__a_viewpoint?ev=prf_pub Eryomin A.L. Information ecology - a viewpoint] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102110632/http://www.researchgate.net/publication/240515256_Information_ecology__a_viewpoint?ev=prf_pub |date=2014-11-02 }}// International Journal of Environmental Studies. - 1998. - Vol. 54. - pp. 241-253.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intellectual property considerations==
One of the central paradoxes of the information society is that it makes information easily reproducible, leading to a variety of freedom/control problems relating to [[intellectual property]]. Essentially, business and capital, whose place becomes that of producing and selling information and knowledge, seems to require control over this new resource so that it can effectively be managed and sold as the basis of the information economy. However, such control can prove to be both technically and socially problematic. Technically because [[copy protection]] is often easily circumvented and socially ''rejected'' because the users and citizens of the information society can prove to be unwilling to accept such absolute [[commodification]] of the facts and information that compose their environment.

Responses to this concern range from the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] in the United States (and similar legislation elsewhere) which make [[copy protection]] (see [[Digital rights management]]) circumvention illegal, to the [[free software]], [[open source]] and [[copyleft]] movements, which seek to encourage and disseminate the "freedom" of various information products (traditionally both as in "gratis" or free of cost, and liberty, as in freedom to use, explore and share).

Caveat: Information society is often used by politicians meaning something like "we all do internet now"; the sociological term information society (or informational society) has some deeper implications about change of societal structure. Because we lack political control of intellectual property, we are lacking in a concrete map of issues, an analysis of costs and benefits, and functioning political groups that are unified by common interests representing different opinions of this diverse situation that are prominent in the information society.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, James. “A Politics of Intellectual Property: Environmentalism for the Net?” Duke Law Journal, vol. 47, no. 1, 1997, pp. 87–116.

{{pp-pc}}

A '''calculation''' is a deliberate [[mathematical]] process that transforms a plurality of inputs into a singular or plurality of outputs, known also as a result or results. The term is used in a variety of senses, from the very definite [[arithmetic]]al calculation of using an [[algorithm]], to the vague [[heuristic]]s of calculating a strategy in a competition, or calculating the chance of a successful relationship between two people.

For example, [[multiplying]] 7 by 6 is a simple algorithmic calculation. Extracting the [[square root]] or the [[cube root]] of a number using mathematical models is a more complex algorithmic calculation.
                                                                                      
[[Statistical estimation]]s of the likely election results from opinion polls also involve algorithmic calculations, but produces ranges of possibilities rather than exact answers.

To ''calculate'' means to determine mathematically in the case of a number or amount, or in the case of an abstract problem to deduce the answer using [[logic]], [[reason]] or [[common sense]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/calculate|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180831035348/https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/calculate|url-status=dead|archive-date=August 31, 2018|title=calculate {{!}} Definition of calculate in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The English word derives from the [[Latin]] {{lang|la|calculus}}, which originally meant a [[pebble]] (from Latin {{lang|la|calx}}), for instance the small stones used as a counters on an [[abacus]] ({{langx|la|abacus|link=no}}, {{langx|el|ἄβαξ|translit=abax|translit-std=ALA-LC}}). The abacus was an instrument used by Greeks and Romans for arithmetic calculations, preceding the [[slide-rule]] and the [[electronic calculator]], and consisted of perforated pebbles sliding on iron bars.

In [[cognitive psychology]], '''information processing''' is an approach to the goal of understanding human thinking that treats [[cognition]] as essentially [[Computing|computational]] in nature, with the [[mind]] being the ''software'' and the [[brain]] being the ''hardware''.{{sfn|Shannon &amp; Weaver|1963}} It arose in the 1940s and 1950s, after World War II.{{sfn|Sternberg|2012}} The information processing approach in psychology is closely allied to the [[computational theory of mind]] in philosophy; it is also related to [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]] in psychology and [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]] in philosophy.{{sfn|Horst|2011}}

==Two types==
Information processing  may  be ''vertical'' or ''horizontal'', either of which  may be ''centralized'' or [[decentralized]] (''distributed''). The [[horizontally distributed processing]] approach of the mid-1980s became popular under the name [[connectionism]]. The connectionist network is made up of different nodes, and it works by a "priming effect," and this happens when a "prime node activates a connected node".{{sfn|Sternberg|2012}} But "unlike in [[semantic network]]s, it is not a single node that has a specific meaning, but rather the knowledge is represented in a combination of differently activated nodes"(Goldstein, as cited in Sternberg, 2012).

==Models and theories==
{{further|Information processing theory}}

There are several proposed models or theories that describe the way in which we process information.
Every individual has different information overload point with the same information load because individuals have different information-processing capacities.{{sfn|Eppler &amp; Mengis|2004}}

===Sternberg's triarchic theory of intelligence===
[[Robert Sternberg|Sternberg]]'s [[Triarchic theory of intelligence|theory of intelligence]] is made up of three different components: creative, analytical, and practical abilities.{{sfn|Sternberg|2012}} [[Creativeness]] is the ability to have new original ideas, and being analytical can help a person decide whether the idea is a good one or not. "Practical abilities are used to implement the ideas and persuade others of their value".{{sfn|Sternberg|2012|page=21}} In the middle of Sternberg's theory is [[cognition]] and with that is information processing. In Sternberg's theory, he says that information processing is made up of three different parts, meta components, performance components, and knowledge-acquisition components.{{sfn|Sternberg|2012}} These processes move from higher-order executive functions to lower-order functions. Meta components are used for planning and evaluating problems, while performance components follow the orders of the meta components, and the [[knowledge acquisition|knowledge-acquisition]] component learns how to solve the problems.{{sfn|Sternberg|2012}} This theory in action can be explained by working on an art project. First is a decision about what to draw, then a plan and a sketch. During this process there is simultaneous monitoring of the process, and whether it is producing the desired accomplishment. All these steps fall under the meta component processing, and the performance component is the art. The knowledge-acquisition portion is the learning or improving drawing skills. {{cn|date=September 2024}}

===Information processing model: the working memory===
[[File:Information Processing Model - Atkinson &amp; Shiffrin.jpg|alt=information processing model with sensory memory, working, memory and long-term memory|thumb|400x400px|Adapted from Atkinson, R.C. and Shiffrin, R.M. (1968). 'Human memory: A Proposed System and its Control Processes'.]]
Information processing has been described as "the sciences concerned with gathering, manipulating, storing, retrieving, and classifying recorded information".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/information+processing | title=Definition of information processing | work=The Free Dictionary | access-date=July 26, 2016 |year=2012|publisher= Princeton University}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Atkinson-Shiffrin memory model]] or multi-store model, for information to be firmly implanted in memory it must pass through three stages of mental processing: [[sensory memory]], [[short-term memory]], and [[long-term memory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Psychology of Learning and Motivation|last1=Atkinson|first1=R.C.|last2=Shiffrin|first2=R.M.|publisher=Academic Press|year=1968|location=New York|pages=89–195|chapter=Human memory: A proposed system and its control processes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of this is the working memory model.  This includes the central executive, phonologic loop, episodic buffer, visuospatial sketchpad, verbal information, long-term memory, and visual information.{{sfn|Sternberg|2012}}  The central executive is like the secretary of the brain.  It decides what needs attention and how to respond. The central executive then leads to three different subsections.  The first is phonological storage, subvocal rehearsal, and the phonological loop.  These sections work together to understand words, put the information into memory, and then hold the memory.  The result is verbal information storage.  The next subsection is the visuospatial sketchpad which works to store visual images.  The storage capacity is brief but leads to an understanding of visual stimuli.  Finally, there is an episodic buffer.  This section is capable of taking information and putting it into long-term memory.  It is also able to take information from the phonological loop and visuospatial sketchpad, combining them with long-term memory to make "a unitary episodic representation.{{sfn|Sternberg|2012}}  
In order for these to work, the sensory register takes in via the five senses: visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory, and taste. These are all present since birth and are able to handle simultaneous processing (e.g., food – taste it, smell it, see it). In general, learning benefits occur when there is a developed process of pattern recognition. The sensory register has a large capacity and its behavioral response is very short (1–3 seconds). 
Within this model, sensory store and short term memory or working memory has limited capacity. Sensory store is able to hold very limited amounts of information for very limited amounts of time.  This phenomenon is very similar to having a picture taken with a flash.  For a few brief moments after the flash goes off, the flash it seems to still be there.  However, it is soon gone and there is no way to know it was there.{{sfn|Sternberg|2012}} Short term memory holds information for slightly longer periods of time, but still has a limited capacity. According to Linden,{{sfn|Linden|2007}} "The capacity of STM had initially been estimated at "[[seven plus or minus two]]" items,{{sfn|Miller|1956}} which fits the observation from neuropsychological testing that the average digit span of healthy adults is about seven.{{sfn|Cowan et al.|2005}} However, it emerged that these numbers of items can only be retained if they are grouped into so-called chunks, using perceptual or conceptual associations between individual stimuli." Its duration is of 5–20 seconds before it is out of the subject's mind. This occurs often with names of people newly introduced to. Images or information based on meaning are stored here as well, but it decays without rehearsal or repetition of such information. 
On the other hand, long-term memory has a potentially unlimited capacity{{sfn|Sternberg|2012}} and its duration is as good as indefinite. Although sometimes it is difficult to access, it encompasses everything learned until this point in time. One might become forgetful or feel as if the information is on the [[tip of the tongue]]. {{cn|date=September 2024}}

===Cognitive development theory===
Another approach to viewing the ways in which information is processed in humans was suggested by [[Jean Piaget]] in what is called the ''Piaget's Cognitive Development Theory''.{{sfn|Presnell|1999}} Piaget developed his model based on development and growth. He identified four different stages between different age brackets characterized by the type of information and by a distinctive thought process. The four stages are: the sensorimotor (from birth to 2 years), preoperational (2–6 years), concrete operational (6–11 years), and formal operational periods (11 years and older). During the sensorimotor stage, newborns and toddlers rely on their senses for information processing to which they respond with reflexes. In the preoperational stage, children learn through imitation and remain unable to take other people's point of view. The concrete operational stage is characterized by the developing ability to use logic and to consider multiple factors to solve a problem. The last stage is the formal operational, in which preadolescents and adolescents begin to understand abstract concepts and to develop the ability to create arguments and counter arguments. {{cn|date=September 2024}}

Furthermore, adolescence is characterized by a series of changes in the biological, cognitive, and social realms. In the cognitive area, the brain's [[prefrontal cortex]] as well as the [[limbic system]] undergoes important changes. The prefrontal cortex is the part of the brain that is active when engaged in complicated cognitive activities such as planning, generating goals and strategies, intuitive decision-making, and [[metacognition]] (thinking about thinking). This is consistent with Piaget's last stage of formal operations.{{sfn|McLeod|2010}} The prefrontal cortex becomes complete between adolescence and early adulthood. The limbic system is the part of the brain that modulates reward sensitivity based on changes in the levels of [[neurotransmitter]]s (e.g., [[dopamine]]) and [[emotions]]. {{cn|date=September 2024}}

In short, cognitive abilities vary according to our development and stages in life. It is at the adult stage that we are better able to be better planners, process and comprehend abstract concepts, and evaluate risks and benefits more aptly than an adolescent or child would be able to. {{cn|date=September 2024}}

In computing, ''information processing'' broadly refers to the use of algorithms to transform data—the defining activity of computers;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Dictionary of Computing | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=9780192800466 | edition=4th | first=Valerie | last=Illingworth | series=Oxford Paperback Reference | page=[https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofcomp00illi/page/241 241] | date=11 December 1997 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofcomp00illi/page/241 }}&lt;/ref&gt; indeed, a broad computing professional organization is known as the International Federation for Information Processing ([[IFIP]]). It is essentially synonymous with the terms [[data processing]] or [[computation]], although with a more general connotation.&lt;ref name="Ralston2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anthony Ralston|title=Encyclopedia of computer science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yQ9LAQAAIAAJ|year=2000|publisher=Nature Pub.

'''Information management''' ('''IM''') is the appropriate and optimized capture, storage, retrieval, and use of [[information]]. It may be [[personal information management]] or organizational. Information management for [[organization]]s concerns a cycle of organizational activity: the acquisition of information from one or more sources, the custodianship and the distribution of that information to those who need it, and its ultimate disposal through [[archiving]] or deletion and extraction.

This cycle of information organisation involves a variety of [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]s, including those who are responsible for assuring the [[quality (business)|quality]], [[accessibility]] and [[utility]] of acquired information; those who are responsible for its safe [[Data storage device|storage]] and [[:wikt:disposal|disposal]]; and those who need it for [[decision making]]. Stakeholders might have rights to originate, change, distribute or delete information according to organisational information management [[policies]].

Information management embraces all the generic concepts of management, including the [[planning]], [[organizing (management)|organizing]], structuring, [[Business process|process]]ing, [[Internal control|control]]ling, [[evaluation]] and [[Data reporting|reporting]] of information activities, all of which is needed in order to meet the needs of those with organisational roles or functions that depend on information. These generic concepts allow the information to be presented to the audience or the correct group of people. After individuals are able to put that information to use, it then gains more value.

Information management is closely related to, and overlaps with, the management of [[data]], [[system]]s, [[technology]], [[Business process|process]]es and – where the availability of information is critical to organisational success – [[strategy]]. This broad view of the realm of information management contrasts with the earlier, more traditional view, that the [[Project life cycle|life cycle]] of managing information is an operational matter that requires specific procedures, organisational capabilities and standards that deal with information as a [[product (business)|product]] or a service.

==History==

===Emergent ideas out of data management===
In the 1970s, the management of information largely concerned matters closer to what would now be called [[data management]]: [[punched cards]], [[magnetic tape]]s and other record-keeping [[Digital media|media]], involving a life cycle of such formats requiring origination, distribution, backup, maintenance and disposal. At this time the huge potential of [[information technology]] began to be recognised: for example a single [[Integrated circuit|chip]] storing a whole [[book]], or [[electronic mail]] moving messages instantly around the world, remarkable ideas at the time.&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;Evans, C., 1979. ''The Mighty Micro'', London: Victor Gollancz.&lt;/ref&gt; With the proliferation of information technology and the extending reach of information systems in the 1980s and 1990s,&lt;ref name="Venkat0"&gt;Venkatraman, N., 1994. IT-enabled business transformation: from automation to business scope redefinition. ''[[MIT Sloan Management Review]]'', 35(2), pp.73–87&lt;/ref&gt; information management took on a new form. Progressive businesses such as [[BP]] transformed the vocabulary of what was then "[[IT management]]", so that "[[systems analyst]]s" became "[[business analyst]]s", "monopoly supply" became a mixture of "[[insourcing]]" and "[[outsourcing]]", and the large IT function was transformed into "lean teams" that began to allow some agility in the processes that harness information for [[business benefit]].&lt;ref name="Cross and Earl"&gt;Cross, J. &amp; Earl, M., 1997. Transformation of the IT function at British Petroleum. ''MIS Quarterly'', 21(4), page 403&lt;/ref&gt; The scope of [[senior management]] interest in information at BP extended from the creation of value through improved [[business process]]es, based upon the effective management of information, permitting the implementation of appropriate information systems (or "[[application software|applications]]") that were operated on [[IT infrastructure]] that was outsourced.&lt;ref name="Cross and Earl" /&gt; In this way, information management was no longer a simple job that could be performed by anyone who had nothing else to do, it became highly strategic and a matter for [[senior management]] attention. An understanding of the technologies involved, an ability to manage information systems [[project]]s and [[business change]] well, and a willingness to align technology and business strategies all became necessary.&lt;ref name="Ward and Peppard"&gt;Ward, J. &amp; Peppard, J., 2002. ''Strategic Planning for Information Systems'' (3rd Edition), Chichester: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt;

===Positioning information management in the bigger picture===
In the transitional period leading up to the strategic view of information management, Venkatraman, a strong advocate of this transition and transformation,&lt;ref name="Venkat2"&gt;Venkatraman, N., 1994. IT-enabled business transformation: from automation to business scope redefinition. ''Sloan Management Review'', 35(2), pp.73–87.&lt;/ref&gt; proffered a simple arrangement of ideas that succinctly brought together the [[Data management|management of data]], information, and [[knowledge management|knowledge]] (see the figure) argued that:

* Data that is maintained in IT infrastructure has to be ''interpreted'' in order to render information.
* The information in our information systems has to be ''understood'' in order to emerge as knowledge.
* Knowledge allows managers to ''take effective decisions''.
* Effective decisions have to lead to ''appropriate actions''. 
* Appropriate actions are expected to deliver ''meaningful results''.

[[File:DIKAR model.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|This simple model summarises a presentation by Venkatraman in 1996, as reported by Ward and Peppard (2002, page 207).&lt;ref name="Ward and Peppard"/&gt;]]
This is often referred to as the DIKAR model: Data, Information, Knowledge, Action and Result,&lt;ref name="Venkat1"&gt;Venkatraman, N., 1996. Managing IT resources as a value center, ''IS Executive Seminar Series, Cranfield School of Management''&lt;/ref&gt; it gives a strong clue as to the layers involved in aligning technology and organisational strategies, and it can be seen as a pivotal moment in changing attitudes to information management.  The recognition that information management is an investment that must deliver meaningful results is important to all modern organisations that depend on information and good decision-making for their success.&lt;ref name="Bytheway"&gt;Bytheway, A., 2015. [https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319119083 Investing in Information: the Information Management Body of Knowledge], Geneva: Springer&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical background==

===Behavioural and organisational theories===
It is commonly believed that good information management is crucial to the smooth working of organisations, and although there is no commonly accepted [[theory]] of information management ''per se'', behavioural and organisational theories help. Following the [[behavioural science]] theory of management, mainly developed at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] and prominently supported by March and Simon,&lt;ref name="March and Simon" /&gt; most of what goes on in modern organizations is actually information handling and decision making. One crucial factor in information handling and decision making is an individual's ability to process information and to make decisions under limitations that might derive from the context: a person's age, the situational complexity, or a lack of requisite quality in the information that is at hand – all of which is exacerbated by the rapid advance of technology and the new kinds of [[system]] that it enables, especially as the [[social web]] emerges as a phenomenon that business cannot ignore. And yet, well before there was any general recognition of the importance of information management in organisations, March and Simon &lt;ref name="March and Simon"&gt;March, J.G. &amp; Simon, H.A., 1958. ''Organizations'', Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; argued that organizations have to be considered as [[cooperative systems]], with a high level of information processing and a vast need for decision making at various levels. Instead of using the model of the "[[economic man]]", as advocated in classical theory &lt;ref name="Opp"&gt;see Opp, K.-D., 1985. Sociology and economic man. ''Zeitschrift für die gesamte Staatswissenschaft/Journal of Institutional and Theoretical Economics'', pp.213–243&lt;/ref&gt; they proposed "[[administrative man]]" as an alternative, based on their argumentation about the cognitive limits of rationality. Additionally they proposed the notion of [[satisficing]], which entails searching through the available alternatives until an acceptability threshold is met - another idea that still has currency.&lt;ref name="Winter"&gt;Winter, S.G., 2000. The satisficing principle in capability learning. ''Strategic Management Journal'', 21(10-11), pp.981–996&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic theory===
In addition to the organisational factors mentioned by March and Simon, there are other issues that stem from economic and environmental dynamics. There is the cost of collecting and evaluating the information needed to take a decision, including the time and effort required.&lt;ref name="Hedberg"&gt;Hedberg, Bo (1981), "How organizations learn and unlearn", in: Nyström, P.C. &amp; Starbuck, W.H., ''Handbook of Organizational Design'', Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; The [[transaction cost]] associated with information processes can be high. In particular, established organizational rules and procedures can prevent the taking of the most appropriate decision, leading to sub-optimum outcomes.&lt;ref name="Mackenzie"&gt;Mackenzie K.D. (1978), ''Organizational Structures'', AHM Publishing Corporation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mullins"&gt;Mullins, L.J (1993), ''Management and Organizational Behaviours'', 3rd ed., Pitman Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; This is an issue that has been presented as a major problem with bureaucratic organizations that lose the economies of strategic change because of entrenched attitudes.&lt;ref name="Wigand"&gt;Wigand, Rolf T., Picot, Arnold and Reichwald, Ralf (1997), ''Information, Organization and Management: Expanding Markets and Corporate Boundaries'', Wiley &amp; Sons&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategic information management==

===Background===
According to the Carnegie Mellon School an organization's ability to process information is at the core of organizational and managerial [[competence (human resources)|competency]], and an organization's strategies must be designed to improve information processing capability &lt;ref name="Cyert"&gt;Cyert, R.M. &amp; March, J.G., 1959. A behavioural theory of organizational objectives. ''Modern Organization Theory'', Wiley, New York, pp.76–90&lt;/ref&gt; and as information systems that provide that capability became formalised and automated, competencies were severely tested at many levels.&lt;ref name="Morton"&gt;Morton, M.S.S., 1991. ''The corporation of the 1990s: Information technology and organizational transformation'', Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; It was recognised that organisations needed to be able to learn and adapt in ways that were never so evident before &lt;ref name="Senge"&gt;Senge, P.M., 1990. ''The fifth discipline'', Doubleday&lt;/ref&gt; and academics began to organise and publish definitive works concerning the strategic management of information, and information systems.&lt;ref name="Ward and Peppard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Earl"&gt;Earl, M.J., 1989. ''Management Strategies for Information Technology'', Upper Saddle River, NJ, USA: Prentice-Hall, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Concurrently, the ideas of [[business process]] management&lt;ref name="Hammer and Champy"&gt;Hammer, M. &amp; Champy, J., 2009. ''Reengineering the Corporation: Manifesto for Business Revolution'', A, Zondervan&lt;/ref&gt; and [[knowledge management]]&lt;ref name="Nonaka and Takeuchi"&gt;Nonaka, I. &amp; Takeuchi, H., 1995. ''The knowledge creating company: how Japanese companies create the dynamics of innovation'', New York, NY, USA: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; although much of the optimistic early thinking about [[business process redesign]] has since been discredited in the information management literature.&lt;ref name="Belmiro"&gt;Belmiro, T., Gardiner, P. &amp; Simmons, J., 1997. Business process re-engineering—A discredited vocabulary? ''International Journal of Information Management'', 17(1), pp.21–33&lt;/ref&gt; In the strategic studies field, it is considered of the highest priority the understanding of the information environment, conceived as the aggregate of individuals, organizations, and systems that collect, process, disseminate, or act on information. This environment consists of three interrelated dimensions which continuously interact with individuals, organizations, and systems. These dimensions are the physical, informational, and cognitive.&lt;ref&gt;Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, U.S. Army (2012). Information Operations. Joint Publication 3-13. Joint Doctrine Support Division, 116 Lake View Parkway, Suffolk, VA., p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aligning technology and business strategy with information management===

Venkatraman has provided a simple view of the requisite capabilities of an organisation that wants to manage information well – the [[DIKAR]] model (see above). He also worked with others to understand how technology and business strategies could be appropriately aligned in order to identify specific capabilities that are needed.&lt;ref name="Henderson and Venkat"&gt;Henderson, J.C. &amp; Venkatraman, N., 1993. Strategic alignment: leveraging information technology for transforming organizations. ''IBM Systems Journal'', 32(1), pp.4–16&lt;/ref&gt; This work was paralleled by other writers in the world of consulting,&lt;ref name="Zachman"&gt;Zachman, J. A. (1987). A framework for information systems architecture. ''IBM Systems Journal'', 26(3), 590–616&lt;/ref&gt; practice,&lt;ref name="Cross"&gt;Cross, J., 1995. IT outsourcing : British Petroleum's competitive approach. ''Harvard Business Review'', 73(3), p.94&lt;/ref&gt; and academia.&lt;ref name="Ward2"&gt;Ward, J. &amp; Daniel, E., 2005. ''Benefits Management: Delivering Value from IS and IT Investments'', Chichester: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt;

===A contemporary portfolio model for information===
Bytheway has collected and organised basic tools and techniques for information management in a single volume.&lt;ref name="Bytheway" /&gt;  At the heart of his view of information management is a portfolio model that takes account of the surging interest in external sources of information and the need to organise un-structured information external so as to make it useful (see the figure).

[[File:An Information Portfolio.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|This portfolio model organizes issues of internal and external sourcing and management of information, that may be either structured or unstructured.]]

Such an information portfolio as this shows how information can be gathered and usefully organised, in four stages:

'''Stage 1''': Taking advantage of [[public information]]: recognise and adopt well-structured external schemes of reference data, such as post codes, weather data, GPS positioning data and travel timetables, exemplified in the personal computing press.&lt;ref name="Ashbrook"&gt;Ashbrook, D. &amp; Starner, T., 2003. Using GPS to learn significant locations and predict movement across multiple users. ''Personal and Ubiquitous Computing'', 7(5), pp.275–286&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stage 2''': Tagging the noise on the [[World Wide Web]]: use existing schemes such as [[post code]]s and [[GPS]] data or more typically by adding “tags”, or construct a formal [[ontology (information science)|ontology]] that provides structure. Shirky provides an overview of these two approaches.&lt;ref name="Shirky"&gt;Shirky, C., 2005. Shirky: Ontology is Overrated -- Categories, Links, and Tags. ''Clay Shirky's Writings About the Internet''. Available at: http://shirky.com/writings/ontology_overrated.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220122714/http://www.shirky.com/writings/ontology_overrated.html |date=December 20, 2016 }} [Accessed May 23, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stage 3''': Sifting and analysing: in the wider world the generalised ontologies that are under development extend to hundreds of entities and hundreds of relations between them and provide the means to elicit meaning from large volumes of data. Structured data in databases works best when that structure reflects a higher-level information model – an ontology, or an [[entity-relationship model]].&lt;ref name="Noy"&gt;Noy, N.F., McGuinness, D.L. &amp; others, 2001. Ontology development 101: A guide to creating your first ontology, ''Stanford knowledge systems laboratory technical report KSL-01-05 and Stanford medical informatics technical report SMI-2001-0880''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stage 4''': Structuring and archiving: with the large volume of data available from sources such as the [[social web]] and from the miniature [[telemetry]] systems used in personal [[health management]], new ways to archive and then trawl data for meaningful information. [[Map-reduce]] methods, originating from [[functional programming]], are a more recent way of eliciting information from large archival [[dataset]]s that is becoming interesting to regular businesses that have very large data resources to work with, but it requires advanced multi-processor resources.&lt;ref name="Chu"&gt;Chu, C. et al., 2007. Map-reduce for machine learning on multicore. ''Advances in neural information processing systems'', 19, p.281&lt;/ref&gt;

===Competencies to manage information well===
In 2004, the management system "[[Information Management Body of Knowledge]]" was first published on the World Wide Web&lt;ref name="IMBOK"&gt;IMBOK, 2004. ''The Information Management Body of Knowledge''. Available at: http://www.imbok.org [Accessed May 12, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; 
and set out to show that the required management competencies to derive real benefits from an investment in information are complex and multi-layered. The framework model that is the basis for understanding competencies comprises six "knowledge" areas and four "process" areas:

[[File:IMBOK Framework.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|This framework is the basis of organising the "Information Management Body of Knowledge" first made available in 2004. This version is adapted by the addition of "Business information" in 2014.]]
;The information management knowledge areas
The IMBOK is based on the argument that there are six areas of required management competency, two of which ("business process management" and "business information management") are very closely related.&lt;ref name="Bytheway2"&gt;Bytheway, A., 2015. ''Investing in Information:  the Information Management Body of Knowledge'', Geneva: Springer,
 p29&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Information technology''': The pace of change of [[technology]] and the pressure to constantly acquire the newest technological products can undermine the stability of the [[infrastructure]] that supports systems, and thereby optimises [[business process]]es and delivers benefits. It is necessary to manage the "[[supply side]]" and recognise that technology is, increasingly, becoming a [[commodity]].&lt;ref name="Carr"&gt;Carr, N., 2003. IT doesn't matter. In ''Wringing real value from IT''. HBR OnPoint, pp. 3–10&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Information system''': While historically information systems were developed [[in-house]], over the years it has become possible to acquire most of the software systems that an organisation needs from the [[Application software|software package]] industry. However, there is still the potential for [[competitive advantage]] from the implementation of new systems ideas that deliver to the strategic intentions of organisations.&lt;ref name="Ward and Peppard"/&gt;
* '''Business processes and Business information''': [[Information system]]s are applied to [[business process]]es in order to improve them, and they bring data to the business that becomes useful as [[business information]]. [[Business process management]] is still seen as a relatively new idea because it is not universally adopted, and it has been difficult in many cases; business ''information'' management is even more of a challenge.&lt;ref name="Belmiro0"&gt;Belmiro, T.R. et al., 2000. Are BPR practitioners really addressing business processes? ''International Journal of Operations &amp; Production Management'', 20(10), pp.1183–1203&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Davenport"&gt;Davenport, T.H. &amp; Short, J., 2003. Information technology and business process redesign. ''Operations management: critical perspectives on business and management'', 1, p.97&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Business benefit''': What are the benefits that we are seeking? It is necessary not only to be brutally honest about what ''can'' be achieved, but also to ensure the active management and assessment of benefit delivery. Since the emergence and popularisation of the [[Balanced scorecard]]&lt;ref name="Kaplan and Norton"&gt;Kaplan, R. &amp; Norton, D., 1996. ''The balanced scorecard - translating strategy into action'', Boston MA: Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt; there has been huge interest in business performance management but not much serious effort has been made to relate business performance management to the benefits of information technology investments and the introduction of new [[information system]]s until the turn of the [[millennium]].&lt;ref name="Ward2" /&gt;
* '''Business strategy''': Although a long way from the workaday issues of managing information in organisations, [[strategy]] in most organisations simply has to be informed by information technology and information systems opportunities, whether to address poor performance or to improve differentiation and [[Competition (companies)|competitiveness]]. Strategic analysis tools such as the [[value chain]] and [[critical success factor]] analysis are directly dependent on proper attention to the information that is (or could be) managed &lt;ref name="Ward and Peppard"/&gt;

;The information management processes
Even with full capability and competency within the six knowledge areas, it is argued that things can still go wrong. The problem lies in the migration of ideas and information management value from one area of competency to another. Summarising what Bytheway explains in some detail (and supported by selected secondary references):&lt;ref name="Bytheway3"&gt;Bytheway, A., 2015. ''Investing in Information: the Information Management Body of Knowledge'', Geneva: Springer,
 p31&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Projects''': Information technology is without value until it is engineered into information systems that meet the needs of the business by means of good [[project management]].&lt;ref name="Schwalbe"&gt;Schwalbe, K., 2013. ''Information technology project management'', Cengage Learning&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Business change''': The best information systems succeed in delivering benefits through the achievement of change within the business systems, but people do not appreciate change that makes new demands upon their skills in the ways that new information systems often do. Contrary to common expectations, there is some evidence that the [[public sector]] has succeeded with information technology induced [[business change]].&lt;ref name="Scholl"&gt;Scholl, H.J., 2005. E-government-induced business process change (BPC): An empirical study of current practices. ''International Journal of Electronic Government Research'' (IJEGR), 1(2), pp.27–49&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Business operations''': With new systems in place, with [[business process]]es and [[business information]] improved, and with staff finally ready and able to work with new processes, then the business can get to work, even when new systems extend far beyond the boundaries of a single business.&lt;ref name="Seed"&gt;Saeed, K.A., Malhotra, M.K. &amp; Grover, V., 2005. Examining the Impact of Interorganizational Systems on Process Efficiency and Sourcing Leverage in Buyer–Supplier Dyads. ''Decision Sciences'', 36(3), pp.365–396&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Performance management''': [[Investment]]s are no longer solely about financial results, financial success must be balanced with internal efficiency, [[customer satisfaction]], and with [[organisational learning]] and development.&lt;ref name="Kaplan and Norton" /&gt;

===Summary===
There are always many ways to see a business, and the information management viewpoint is only one way. Other areas of business activity will also contribute to strategy – it is not only good information management that moves a business forwards. [[Corporate governance]], [[human resource management]], [[product development]] and [[marketing]] will all have an important role to play in strategic ways, and we must not see one domain of activity alone as the sole source of strategic success. On the other hand, corporate governance, human resource management, product development and marketing are all dependent on effective information management, and so in the final analysis our competency to manage information well, on the broad basis that is offered here, can be said to be predominant.

==Operationalising information management==

===Managing requisite change===
Organizations are often confronted with many information management challenges and issues at the [[operational level]], especially when [[organisational change]] is engendered. The novelty of new [[systems architecture]]s and a lack of experience with new styles of information management requires a level of organisational [[change management]] that is notoriously difficult to deliver. As a result of a general organisational reluctance to change, to enable new forms of information management, there might be (for example): a shortfall in the requisite resources, a failure to acknowledge new classes of information and the new procedures that use them, a lack of support from senior management leading to a loss of strategic vision, and even political manoeuvring that undermines the operation of the whole organisation.&lt;ref name="Knights and Murray"&gt;Knights, D. &amp; Murray, F., 1994. ''Managers Divided'', Chichester: John Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; However, the implementation of new forms of information management should normally lead to operational benefits.

===Galbraith's early work===
In early work, taking an information processing view of organisation design, Jay [[Galbraith]] has identified five tactical areas to increase information processing capacity and reduce the need for information processing.&lt;ref name="Galbraith"&gt;Galbraith, J.R., 1977. ''Organization design'', Addison Wesley&lt;/ref&gt;

* Developing, implementing, and monitoring all aspects of the "environment" of an organization.
* Creation of slack resources so as to decrease the load on the overall [[hierarchy]] of resources and to reduce information processing relating to overload.
* Creation of self-contained tasks with defined boundaries and that can achieve proper closure, and with all the [[resource]]s at hand required to perform the task.
* Recognition of lateral relations that cut across functional units, so as to move decision power to the [[Business process|process]] instead of fragmenting it within the hierarchy.
* Investment in vertical information systems that route [[information flow]]s for a specific task (or set of tasks) in accordance to the applied [[business logic]].

===Matrix organisation===
The lateral relations concept leads to an organizational form that is different from the simple hierarchy, the "[[matrix organization]]". This brings together the vertical (hierarchical) view of an organisation and the horizontal (product or project) view of the work that it does visible to the outside world. The creation of a matrix organization is one management response to a persistent fluidity of external demand, avoiding multifarious and spurious responses to episodic demands that tend to be dealt with individually.

It considers the dynamics and properties of the increasingly dense, complex and important digital informational environment. "Information ecology" often is used as [[metaphor]], viewing the [[information space]] as an [[ecosystem]], the '''information ecosystem'''.

Information ecology also makes a connection to the concept of [[collective intelligence]] and [[knowledge ecology]] {{Harv|Pór|2000}}.  Eddy et al. (2014) use information ecology for science-policy integration in ecosystems-based management (EBM).

== Networked information economy ==
In ''[[The Wealth of Networks|The Wealth of Networks: How Social Production Transforms Markets and Freedom]]'', a book published in 2006 and available under a [[Creative Commons]] license on its own wikispace,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yochai Benkler]] provides an analytic framework for the emergence of the networked [[information economy]] that draws deeply on the language and perspectives of information ecology together with observations and analyses of high-visibility examples of successful [[peer production]] processes, citing Wikipedia as a prime example.

[[Bonnie Nardi]] and [[Vicki O'Day]] in their book "Information Ecologies: Using Technology with Heart,"  {{Harv|Nardi|O’Day|1999}} apply the ecology metaphor to local environments, such as libraries and schools, in preference to the more common metaphors for technology as tool, text, or system.

== In different domains / disciplines ==

=== Anthropology ===
Nardi and O’Day's book represents the first specific treatment of information ecology by anthropologists. H.E. Kuchka&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kuchka.org/information-ecology|title=Information Ecology|access-date=2013-12-21|archive-date=2024-01-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240120002344/http://kuchka.org/information-ecology|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; situates information within socially-distributed cognition of cultural systems. Casagrande and Peters&lt;ref&gt;Casagrande, D.G., &amp; C. Peters. 2013. Ecomyopia meets the longue durée: An information ecology of the increasingly arid Southwestern United States. Pp. 97-144 in H. Kopnina &amp; E. Shoreman (Eds.), Environmental Anthropology: Future Directions. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; use information ecology for an anthropological critique of Southwest US water policy. Stepp (1999)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kuchka.org/sites/default/files/stepp.pdf |title=Data |website=kuchka.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; published a prospectus for the anthropological study of information ecology.

=== Knowledge management ===
Information ecology was used as book title by Thomas H. Davenport and Laurence Prusak {{Harv|Davenport|Prusak|1997}}, with a focus on the organization dimensions of information ecology. There was also an academic research project at [[Distributed Systems Technology Centre|DSTC]] called ''Information ecology'', concerned with distributed information systems and online communities.

=== Law ===
Law schools represent another area where the phrase is gaining increasing acceptance, e.g.
NYU Law School Conference Towards a Free Information Ecology&lt;ref&gt;
Conference [http://www1.law.nyu.edu/ili/conferences/freeinfo2000/aboutconf/index.html A Free Information Ecology in the Digital Environment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090329043908/http://www.law.nyu.edu/ili/conferences/freeinfo2000/aboutconf/index.html |date=2009-03-29 }}, New York University School of Law, March 31, 2000 to Sunday, April 2, 2000
&lt;/ref&gt;  and a lecture series on Information ecology at Duke University Law School's [[Center for the Study of the Public Domain]].

=== Library science ===
The field of [[library science]] has seen significant adoption of the term and librarians have been described by Nardi and O'Day as a "keystone species in information ecology",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/digiref/archive/nardi.html |title=Reference Service in a Digital Age: An LC Institute |website=[[Library of Congress]] |access-date=2017-12-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060307005156/http://www.loc.gov/rr/digiref/archive/nardi.html |archive-date=2006-03-07 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sims.berkeley.edu/sfsla/bulletin/sepoct00/info_ecology.html |access-date=April 2, 2004 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040502182859/http://www.sims.berkeley.edu/sfsla/bulletin/sepoct00/info_ecology.html |archive-date=May 2, 2004 |title=Info Ecology Program Notes: "Weirdly Wonderful" - Librarians as Spotted Owls }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and references to information ecology range as far afield as the Collaborative Digital Reference Service of the Library of Congress,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/digiref/source/CDRS-KB-CNI.PPT |title=Archived copy |website=[[Library of Congress]] |access-date=2017-12-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060307010141/http://www.loc.gov/rr/digiref/source/CDRS-KB-CNI.PPT |archive-date=2006-03-07 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; to children's library database administrator in Russia.

=== Science-Policy Integration (SPI) / Ecosystems-Based Management (EBM) ===
Eddy et al. (2014) use principles of information ecology to develop a framework for integrating scientific information in decision-making in ecosystem-based management (EBM).  Using a metaphor of how a species adapts to environmental changes through information processing, they developed a 3-tiered model that differentiates primary, secondary and tertiary levels of information processing, within both the technical and human domains.

[[File:Jetstar 787 Dreamliner Fact Sheet (10181952713).jpg|thumb|[[Jetstar]] [[Boeing 787]] fact sheet]]

A '''factsheet''' or '''fact sheet''', also called '''fact file''', is a single-page [[document]] containing essential information about a [[Product (business)|product]], [[Chemical substance|substance]], [[Service (economics)|service]] or other topic. Factsheets are frequently used to provide information to an [[end user]], [[consumer]] or member of the public in concise, simple language. They generally contain key safety points, operating instructions or basic information about a topic depending on the purpose of the fact sheet.&lt;ref name="Kent state"&gt;{{cite web |title=Fact Sheets |url=https://www.kent.edu/ctl/fact-sheets |website=www.kent.edu |publisher=Kent State University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Typical contents==
Factsheets frequently make use of elements such as lists, [[Table (information)|tables]] and [[diagram]]s to convey meaning quickly and effectively. The language and content of a factsheet depend on its [[target audience]]; a factsheet aimed at professional engineers may use more technical language than one aimed at an end-user.&lt;ref name="ND"&gt;{{cite web |title=Communication Tools: Fact Sheets |url=https://ruralhealth.und.edu/communication/factsheets |website=ruralhealth.und.edu |publisher=University of North Dakota |access-date=17 February 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Factsheets were traditionally printed and physically distributed, often included in the packaging of a product. Many manufacturers now provide digital factsheets as well as or instead of paper-and-ink documents.&lt;ref name="RadioTrade"&gt;{{cite web |title=Fact Sheets |url=https://www.radiotrade.co.uk/resources/brochure-and-data-sheets |website=radiotrade.co.uk |publisher=Multiple |access-date=17 February 2021 |archive-date=17 March 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230317025255/https://www.radiotrade.co.uk/resources/brochure-and-data-sheets |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
*The [[World Health Organization]] provides fact sheets on wide range of health issues&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets|title=Fact sheets|website=www.who.int|language=en|access-date=2020-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The US [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] provides planetary fact sheets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/planetfact.html|title=Planetary Fact Sheets|website=nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[The World Factbook]], a collection from the US [[Central Intelligence Agency]] of tabular factsheets on various countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070601020457/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 1, 2007|title=The World Factbook - Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Federal Republic of Germany]] has published a fact sheet on the unique dual vocational training system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bmwi.de/Redaktion/DE/Downloads/F/Faktenblaetter/fact-sheet-duale-ausbildung.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=55 |title=Fact-sheet Duale Ausbildung |language=de |website=bmwi.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Information technology is a sub-discipline of [[computing]], specifically the application of computers and telecommunications equipment '''to create, process, store, and exchange all kinds of electronic data and information'''. IT is typically used within the context of business operations as opposed to personal or entertainment technologies.

&lt;!--{{context|date=February 2013}}--&gt;
An '''information cascade''' or '''informational cascade''' is a phenomenon described in [[behavioral economics]] and [[network theory]] in which a number of people make the same decision in a sequential fashion. It is similar to, but distinct from [[herd behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Duan|first1=Wenjing|last2=Gu|first2=Bin|last3=Whinston|first3=Andrew B.|title=Informational Cascades and Software Adoption on the Internet: An Empirical Investigation |journal=MIS Quarterly |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=23–48 |date=March 2009|location=Rochester, NY|ssrn=1103165 |jstor=20650277|doi=10.2307/20650277|hdl=2144/42029|s2cid=909115 |hdl-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.cornell.edu/info2040/2016/11/15/the-difference-between-information-cascades-and-herd-behavior/|title=The Difference Between Information Cascades and Herd Behavior : Networks Course blog for INFO 2040/CS 2850/Econ 2040/SOC 2090|access-date=2019-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Çelen|first1=Boğaçhan|last2=Kariv|first2=Shachar|date=May 2004|title=Distinguishing Informational Cascades from Herd Behavior in the Laboratory|journal=American Economic Review|volume=94|issue=3|pages=484–498|doi=10.1257/0002828041464461 |citeseerx=10.1.1.357.3265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An information cascade is generally accepted as a two-step process. For a cascade to begin an individual must encounter a scenario with a decision, typically a binary one. Second, outside factors can influence this decision, such as the individual observing  others' choices and the apparent outcomes.

The two-step process of an informational cascade can be broken down into five basic components:

# There is a [[Decision making|decision to be made]] – for example; whether to adopt a new technology, wear a new style of clothing, eat in a new restaurant, or support a particular political position
# A limited action space exists (e.g. an adopt/reject decision)
# People make the decision sequentially, and each person can observe the choices made by those who acted earlier
# Each person has some information aside from their own that helps guide their decision
# A person can't directly observe the outside information that other people know, but he or she can make inferences about this information from what they do

Social perspectives of cascades, which suggest that agents may act irrationally (e.g., against what they think is optimal) when [[social pressure]]s are great, exist as complements to the concept of information cascades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schiller | first1 = R.J. | year = 1995 | title = Conversation, Information and Herd Behavior | journal = Rhetoric and Economic Behavior | volume = 85 | issue = 3| pages = 181–185 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More often the problem is that the concept of an information cascade is confused with ideas that do not match the two key conditions of the process, such as [[social proof]], [[information diffusion]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1145/988672.988739 |citeseerx=10.1.1.131.4532 |s2cid=526158 |chapter=Information diffusion through blogspace |title=Proceedings of the 13th international conference on World Wide Web |year=2004 |last1=Gruhl |first1=Daniel |last2=Guha |first2=R. |last3=Liben-Nowell |first3=David |last4=Tomkins |first4=Andrew |pages=491–501 |isbn=978-1-58113-844-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[social influence]]. Indeed, the term information cascade has even been used to refer to such processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1145/1935826.1935844 |chapter=Correcting for missing data in information cascades |title=Proceedings of the fourth ACM international conference on Web search and data mining |year=2011 |last1=Sadikov |first1=Eldar |last2=Medina |first2=Montserrat |last3=Leskovec |first3=Jure |last4=Garcia-Molina |first4=Hector |pages=55–64 |isbn=978-1-4503-0493-1 |s2cid=6978077 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basic model ==

This section provides some basic examples of information cascades, as originally described by Bikchandani et al. (1992).&lt;ref name="Bik" /&gt; The basic model has since been developed in a variety of directions to examine its robustness and better understand its implications.&lt;ref name="BikhchandaniHirshleifer1998"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bikhchandani |first1=Sushil |last2=Hirshleifer |first2=David |last3=Welch |first3=Ivo |title=Learning from the Behavior of Others: Conformity, Fads, and Informational Cascades |journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives |date=August 1998 |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=151–170 |doi=10.1257/jep.12.3.151 |doi-access=free |hdl=2027.42/35413 |hdl-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Smith |first1=Lones |last2=Sorensen |first2=Peter |title=Pathological Outcomes of Observational Learning |journal=Econometrica |date=March 2000 |volume=68 |issue=2 |pages=371–398 |doi=10.1111/1468-0262.00113 |hdl=1721.1/64049 |s2cid=14414203 |url=https://curis.ku.dk/portal/da/publications/pathological-outcomes-of-observational-learning(4c2aedb0-74c6-11db-bee9-02004c4f4f50).html |hdl-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Qualitative example ===

Information cascades occur when external information obtained from previous participants in an event overrides one's own private signal, irrespective of the correctness of the former over the latter.  The experiment conducted by Anderson&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Anderson |first1=Lisa R. |last2=Holt |first2=Charles A. |title=Information Cascades in the Laboratory |journal=The American Economic Review |date=1997 |volume=87 |issue=5 |pages=847–862 |jstor=2951328 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  is a useful example of this process.  The experiment consisted of two urns labeled A and B. Urn A contains two balls labeled "a" and one labeled "b". Urn B contains one ball labeled "a" and two labeled "b". The urn from which a ball must be drawn during each run is determined randomly and with equal probabilities (from the throw of a dice). The contents of the chosen urn are emptied into a neutral container. The participants are then asked in random order to draw a marble from this container. This entire process may be termed a "run", and a number of such runs are performed.

Each time a participant picks up a marble, he is to decide which urn it belongs to. His decision is then announced for the benefit of the remaining participants in the room. Thus, the (n+1)th participant has information about the decisions made by all the n participants preceding him, and also his private signal which is the label on the ball that he draws during his turn. The experimenters observed that an information cascade was observed in 41 of 56 such runs. This means, in the runs where the cascade occurred, at least one participant gave precedence to earlier decisions over his own private signal. It is possible for such an occurrence to produce the wrong result. This phenomenon is known as "Reverse Cascade".

=== Quantitative description ===

A person's signal telling them to accept is denoted as {{mvar|H}} (a high signal, where high signifies he should accept), and a signal telling them not to accept is {{mvar|L}} (a low signal).  The model assumes that when the correct decision is to accept, individuals will be more likely to see an {{mvar|H}}, and conversely, when the correct decision is to reject, individuals are more likely to see an {{mvar|L}} signal.  This is essentially a [[conditional probability]] – the probability of {{mvar|H}}  when the correct action is to accept, or &lt;math&gt;P[H|A]&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly &lt;math&gt;P[L|R]&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that an agent gets an {{mvar|L}} signal when the correct action is reject. If these likelihoods are represented by ''q'', then ''q'' &gt; 0.5.  This is summarized in the table below.&lt;ref name="Easley"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/networks-book/|title=Networks, Crowds and Markets: Reasoning about a Highly Connected World|last=Easley|first=David|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|pages=483–506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
|  ''H''       || 1&amp;minus;''q''                || ''q''
|}
 
The first agent determines whether or not to accept solely based on his own signal.  As the model assumes that all agents act rationally, the action (accept or reject) the agent feels is more likely is the action he will choose to take.  This decision can be explained using [[Bayes' rule]]:

&lt;math display="block"&gt;\begin{align}
  P\left(A|H\right) &amp;= \frac{P\left(A\right) P\left(H|A\right)}{P\left(H\right)} \\
                    &amp;= \frac{P\left(A\right) P\left(H|A\right)}{P\left(A\right) P\left(H|A\right) + P\left(R\right) P\left(H|R\right)} \\
                    &amp;= \frac{pq}{pq + \left(1 - p\right)\left(1 - q\right)} \\
                    &amp;&gt; p
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

If the agent receives an {{mvar|H}} signal, then the likelihood of accepting is obtained by calculating &lt;math&gt;P[A|H]&lt;/math&gt;.  The equation says that, by virtue of the fact that ''q'' &gt; 0.5, the first agent, acting only on his private signal, will always increase his estimate of ''p'' with an {{mvar|H}} signal.  Similarly, it can be shown that an agent will always decrease his expectation of ''p'' when he receives a low signal.  Recalling that, if the value, {{mvar|V}}, of accepting is equal to the value of rejecting, then an agent will accept if he believes ''p'' &gt; 0.5, and reject otherwise.  Because this agent started out with the assumption that both accepting and rejecting are equally viable options (''p'' = 0.5), the observation of an {{mvar|H}} signal will allow him to conclude that accepting is the rational choice.

The second agent then considers both the first agent's decision and his own signal, again in a rational fashion.  In general, the ''n''th agent considers the decisions of the previous ''n''-1 agents, and his own signal.  He makes a decision based on Bayesian reasoning to determine the most rational choice.
 
&lt;math display="block"&gt;P (A | \text{Previous}, \text{Personal signal}) = \frac{pq^a (1 - q)^b}{p q^a (1 - q)^b + (1 - p)(1 - q)^a q^b}&lt;/math&gt;
 
Where {{mvar|a}} is the number of accepts in the previous set plus the agent's own signal, and {{mvar|b}} is the number of rejects.  Thus, {{tmath|1=a + b = n}}.  The decision is based on how the value on the right hand side of the equation compares with ''p''.&lt;ref name="Easley"/&gt;

===Explicit model assumptions===

The original model makes several assumptions about human behavior and the world in which humans act,&lt;ref name="Bik"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bikhchandani |first1=Sushil |last2=Hirshleifer |first2=David |last3=Welch |first3=Ivo |title=A Theory of Fads, Fashion, Custom, and Cultural Change as Informational Cascades |journal=Journal of Political Economy |date=October 1992 |volume=100 |issue=5 |pages=992–1026 |doi=10.1086/261849 |s2cid=7784814 |url=http://www.dklevine.com/archive/refs41193.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; some of which are relaxed in later versions&lt;ref name="Easley"/&gt; or in alternate definitions of similar problems, such as the [[diffusion of innovations]]. 
 
#[[Bounded rationality|Boundedly Rational]] Agents: The original Independent Cascade model assumes humans are boundedly rational&lt;ref name=newellsimon&gt;{{cite book|last=Newell|first=A.|title=Human problem solving|url=https://archive.org/details/humanproblemsolv0000newe|url-access=registration|year=1972|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs, NY|isbn=9780134454030 }}&lt;/ref&gt; – that is, they will always make rational decisions based on the information they can observe, but the information they observe may not be complete or correct.  In other words, agents do not have complete knowledge of the world around them (which would allow them to make the correct decision in any and all situations).  In this way, there is a point at which, even if a person has correct knowledge of the idea or action cascading, they can be convinced via social pressures to adopt some alternate, incorrect view of the world.
#[[Complete information|Incomplete Knowledge]] of Others: The original information cascade model assumes that agents have incomplete knowledge of the agents which precede them in the specified order.  As opposed to definitions where agents have some knowledge of the "private information" held by previous agents, the current agent makes a decision based only on the observable action (whether or not to imitate) of those preceding him.  It is important to note that the original creators argue this is a reason why information cascades can be caused by small shocks.
#Behavior of all previous agents is known

=== Resulting conditions ===

#'''Cascades will always occur''' – as discussed, in the simple mode, the likelihood of a cascade occurring increases towards 1 as the number of people making decisions increases towards infinity.
#'''Cascades can be incorrect''' – because agents make decisions with both bounded rationality and probabilistic knowledge of the initial truth (e.g. whether accepting or rejecting is the correct decision), the incorrect behavior may cascade through the system.
#'''Cascades can be based on little information''' – mathematically, a cascade of an infinite length can occur based only on the decision of two people.  More generally, a small set of people who strongly promote an idea as being rational can rapidly influence a much larger subset of the general population
#'''Cascades are fragile''' – because agents receive no extra information after the difference between a and b increases beyond 2, and because such differences can occur at small numbers of agents, agents considering opinions from those agents who are making decisions based on actual information can be dissuaded from a choice rather easily.&lt;ref name="Bik"/&gt; This suggests that cascades are susceptible to the release of public information.&lt;ref name="Bik"/&gt; also discusses this result in the context of the underlying value p changing over time, in which case a cascade can rapidly change course.

== Responding ==

A literature exists that examines how individuals or firms might respond to the existence of informational cascades when they have products to sell but where buyers are unsure of the quality of those products. Curtis Taylor (1999)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=C.|title=Time-on-the-Market as a Sign of Quality.|journal=Review of Economic Studies|year=1999|volume=66|issue=3|pages=555–578|doi=10.1111/1467-937x.00098|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that when selling a house the seller might wish to start with high prices, as failure to sell with low prices is indicative of low quality and might start a cascade on not buying, while failure to sell with high prices could be construed as meaning the house is just over-priced, and prices can then be reduced to get a sale. Daniel Sgroi (2002)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sgroi|first=D.|year=2002|title=Optimizing Information in the Herd: Guinea Pigs, Profits, and Welfare|url=http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/50142/1/WRAP_Sgroi_Paper9.pdf|journal=Games and Economic Behavior|volume=39|pages=137–166|doi=10.1006/game.2001.0881}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that firms might use "guinea pigs" who are given the opportunity to buy early to kick-start an informational cascade through their early and public purchasing decisions, and work by David Gill and Daniel Sgroi (2008)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gill|first=D.|author2=D. Sgroi|title=Sequential Decisions with Tests.|journal=Games and Economic Behavior|year=2008|volume=63|issue=2|pages=663–678|doi=10.1016/j.geb.2006.07.004|citeseerx=10.1.1.322.7566|s2cid=5793119}}&lt;/ref&gt; show that early public tests might have a similar effect (and in particular that passing a "tough test" which is biased against the seller can instigate a cascade all by itself). Bose ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bose|first=S.|author2=G. Orosel |author3=M. Ottaviani |author4=L. Vesterlund |title=Dynamic Monopoly Pricing and Herding.|journal=RAND Journal of Economics|year=2006|volume=37|issue=4|pages=910–928 |doi=10.1111/j.1756-2171.2006.tb00063.x|citeseerx=10.1.1.493.1834|s2cid=2984643}}&lt;/ref&gt; have examined how prices set by a monopolist might evolve in the presence of potential cascade behavior where the monopolist and consumers are unsure of a products quality.

==Examples and fields of application==
Information cascades occur in situations where seeing many people make the same choice provides evidence that outweighs one's own judgment.  That is, one thinks:  "It's more likely that I'm wrong than that all those other people are wrong.  Therefore, I will do as they do."

In what has been termed a [[reputational cascade]], late responders sometimes go along with the decisions of early responders, not just because the late responders think the early responders are right, but also because they perceive their reputation will be damaged if they dissent from the early responders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lemieux |first1=Pierre |title=Following the herd: why do some ideas suddenly become popular, and then die out just as quickly? |journal=Regulation |date=22 December 2003 |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=16–22 |id={{Gale|A113304115}} |ssrn=505764 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Market cascades ===
Information cascades have become one of the topics of [[behavioral economics]], as they are often seen in financial markets where they can feed speculation and create cumulative and excessive [[market price|price moves]], either for the whole market ([[bubble (economics)|market bubble]]) or a specific asset, like a stock that becomes overly popular among investors.{{fact|date=March 2023}}

Marketers also use the idea of cascades to attempt to get a buying cascade started for a new product. If they can induce an initial set of people to adopt the new product, then those who make purchasing decisions later on may also adopt the product even if it is no better than, or perhaps even worse than, competing products. This is most effective if these later consumers are able to observe the adoption decisions, but not how satisfied the early customers actually were with the choice. This is consistent with the idea that cascades arise naturally when people can see what others do but not what they know.{{fact|date=March 2023}}

An example is Hollywood movies. If test screenings suggest a big-budget movie might be a flop, studios often decide to spend more on initial marketing rather than less, with the aim of making as much money as possible on the opening weekend, before word gets around that it's a turkey.{{fact|date=March 2023}}

Information cascades are usually considered by economists:{{fact|date=March 2023}}
* as products of [[rational expectations]] at their start,
* as irrational [[herd behavior]] if they persist for too long, which signals that collective emotions come also into play to feed the cascade.

=== Social networks and social media ===
{{see|social network analysis}}
Dotey et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dotey, A., Rom, H. and Vaca C.|title=Information Diffusion in Social Media|year=2011|publisher=Stanford University|url=https://snap.stanford.edu/class/cs224w-2011/proj/mrom_Finalwriteup_v1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; state that information flows in the form of cascades on the [[social network]]. According to the authors, analysis of [[viral phenomenon|virality]] of information cascades on a social network may lead to many useful applications like determining the most influential individuals within a network. This information can be used for ''maximizing market effectiveness'' or ''influencing [[public opinion]]''. Various structural and temporal features of a network affect cascade virality. Additionally, these models are widely exploited in the problem of [[Rumor spread in social network]] to investigate it and reduce its influence in online social networks.

In contrast to work on information cascades in social networks, the [[social influence]] model of [[belief spread]] argues that people have some notion of the private beliefs of those in their network.&lt;ref name="Friedkin Johnsen 2009 p. "&gt;{{cite book | last1=Friedkin | first1=Noah E. | last2=Johnsen | first2=Eugene C. | title=Social Influence Network Theory | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=Cambridge | year=2009 | isbn=978-0-511-97673-5 | doi=10.1017/cbo9780511976735 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The social influence model, then, relaxes the assumption of information cascades that people are acting only on observable actions taken by others.  In addition, the social influence model focuses on embedding people within a social network, as opposed to a queue.  Finally, the social influence model relaxes the assumption of the information cascade model that people will either complete an action or not by allowing for a continuous scale of the "strength" of an agents belief that an action should be completed.

Information cascades can also restructure the social networks that they pass through. For example, while there is a constant low level of churn in social ties on [[Twitter]]—in any given month, about 9% of all social connections change—there is often a spike in follow and unfollow activity following an information cascade, such as the sharing of a viral tweet.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1145/2566486.2568043 |arxiv=1403.2732 |s2cid=6353961 |chapter=The bursty dynamics of the Twitter information network |title=Proceedings of the 23rd international conference on World wide web |year=2014 |last1=Myers |first1=Seth A. |last2=Leskovec |first2=Jure |pages=913–924 |isbn=978-1-4503-2744-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the tweet-sharing cascade passes through the network, users adjust their social ties, particularly those connected to the original author of the viral tweet: the author of a viral tweet will see both a sudden loss in previous followers and a sudden increase in new followers.

As a part of this cascade-driven reorganization process, information cascades can also create [[Assortative mixing|assortative social networks]], where people tend to be connected to others who are similar in some characteristic. Tweet cascades increase in the similarity between connected users, as users lose ties to more dissimilar users and add new ties to similar users.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Information cascades created by news coverage in the media may also foster [[political polarization]] by [[Echo chamber (media)|sorting social networks along political lines]]: Twitter users who follow and share more polarized news coverage tend to lose social ties to users of the opposite ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tokita |first1=Christopher K. |last2=Guess |first2=Andrew M. |last3=Tarnita |first3=Corina E. |title=Polarized information ecosystems can reorganize social networks via information cascades |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |date=14 December 2021 |volume=118 |issue=50 |pages=e2102147118 |doi=10.1073/pnas.2102147118 |pmc=8685718 |pmid=34876511 |bibcode=2021PNAS..11802147T |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Historical examples ===
* Small protests began in [[Leipzig]], Germany in 1989 with just a handful of activists challenging the [[German Democratic Republic]].&lt;ref name=shirky&gt;{{cite book

* The adoption rate of drought-resistant hybrid seed corn during the [[Great Depression]] and [[Dust Bowl]] was slow despite its significant improvement over the previously available seed corn. Researchers at [[Iowa State University]] were interested in understanding the public's hesitation to the adoption of this significantly improved technology. After conducting 259 interviews with farmers&lt;ref name=carboneau&gt;{{cite journal

=== Empirical studies ===
In addition to the examples above, Information Cascades have been shown to exist in several empirical studies.  Perhaps the best example, given above, is.&lt;ref name="Anderson"/&gt; Participants stood in a line behind an urn which had balls of different colors.  Sequentially, participants would pick a ball out of the urn, look at it, and place it back into the urn.  The agent then voices their opinion of which color of ball (red or blue) there is a majority of in the urn for the rest of the participants to hear.  Participants get a monetary reward if they guess correctly, forcing the concept of rationality.

Other examples include
* De Vany and Walls&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=De Vany|first=A.|author2=D. Walls|title=Uncertainty in the movie industry: does star power reduce the terror of the box office?|journal=Journal of Cultural Economics|year=1999|volume=23|issue=4|pages=285–318|doi=10.1023/a:1007608125988|s2cid=54614446}}&lt;/ref&gt;  create a statistical model of information cascades where an action is required.  They apply this model to the actions people take to go see a movie that has come out at the theatre.  De Vany and Walls validate their model on this data, finding a similar [[Pareto distribution]] of revenue for different movies.
* Walden and Browne also adopt the original Information Cascade model, here into an operational model more practical for real world studies, which allows for analysis based on observed variables.  Walden and Browne test their model on data about adoption of new technologies by businesses, finding support for their hypothesis that information cascades play a role in this adoption&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Walden|first1=Eric|last2=Browne|first2=Glenn|title=Information Cascades in the Adoption of New Technology|journal=ICIS Proceedings|year=2002|url=http://aisel.aisnet.org/icis2002/40/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal aspects==
The negative effects of informational cascades sometimes become a legal concern and laws have been enacted to neutralize them. [[Ward Farnsworth]], a law professor, analyzed the legal aspects of informational cascades and gave several examples in his book ''The Legal Analyst'': in many [[military court]]s, the officers voting to decide a case vote in reverse rank order (the officer of the lowest rank votes first), and he suggested it may be done so the lower-ranked officers would not be tempted by the cascade to vote with the more senior officers, who are believed to have more accurate judgement; another example is that countries such as [[Israel]] and [[France]] have laws that prohibit polling days or weeks before [[election]]s to prevent the effect of informational cascade that may influence the election results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Farnsworth |first1=Ward |title=The Legal Analyst: A Toolkit for Thinking about the Law |date=2007 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-23835-7 |oclc=76828864 }}{{pn|date=March 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Globalization ==
One informational cascade study compared thought processes between Greek and German organic farmers, suggesting discrepancies based upon cultural and socioeconomic differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chatzimichael |first1=Konstantinos |last2=Genius |first2=Margarita |last3=Tzouvelekas |first3=Vangelis |title=Informational cascades and technology adoption: Evidence from Greek and German organic growers |journal=Food Policy |date=December 2014 |volume=49 |pages=186–195 |doi=10.1016/j.foodpol.2014.08.001 |url=http://economics.soc.uoc.gr/wpa/docs/1102.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even further, cascades have been extrapolated to ideas such as financial volatility and monetary policy. In 2004 Helmut Wagner and Wolfram Berger suggested cascades as an analytical vehicle to examine changes to the financial market as it became more globalized. Wagner and Berger noticed structural changes to the framework of understanding financial markets due to globalization; giving rise to volatility in capital flow and spawning uncertainty which affected central banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wagner |first1=Helmut |last2=Berger |first2=Wolfram |title=Globalization, Financial Volatility and Monetary Policy |journal=Empirica |date=June 2004 |volume=31 |issue=2–3 |pages=163–184 |doi=10.1007/s10633-004-0915-4 |citeseerx=10.1.1.466.2938 |s2cid=53471608 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, information cascades are useful in understanding the origins of terrorist tactics. When the attack by Black September occurred in 1972 it was hard not to see the similarities between their tactics and the Baader-Meinhof group (also known as the Red Army Faction [RAF]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Passmore |first1=L. |title=Ulrike Meinhof and the Red Army Faction: Performing Terrorism |date=2011 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-230-37077-7 |oclc=904285976 }}{{pn|date=March 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of these examples portray how the process of cascades were put into use. Moreover, it is important to understand the framework of cascades to move forward in a more globalized society. Establishing a foundation to understanding the passage of information through transnational and multinational organizations, and even more, is critical to the arising modern society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hamlett |first1=Patrick W. |last2=Cobb |first2=Michael D. |title=Potential Solutions to Public Deliberation Problems: Structured Deliberations and Polarization Cascades |journal=Policy Studies Journal |date=November 2006 |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=629–648 |doi=10.1111/j.1541-0072.2006.00195.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Summing up all of these points, cascades, as a general term, encompass a spectrum of different concepts. Information cascades have been the underlying thread in how information is transferred, overwritten, and understood through various cultures spanning from a multitude of different countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Drezner |first1=Daniel W. |title=Weighing the Scales: The Internet's Effect On State-Society Relations |journal=The Brown Journal of World Affairs |date=2010 |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=31–44 |jstor=24590907 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''mental model''' is an internal representation of external [[reality]]: that is, a way of representing reality within one's [[mind]]. Such models are [[hypothesis|hypothesized]] to play a major role in [[cognition]], [[reasoning]] and [[decision-making]]. The term for this concept was coined in 1943 by [[Kenneth Craik]], who suggested that the mind constructs "small-scale [[models]]" of reality that it uses to anticipate events. Mental models can help shape [[behaviour]], including approaches to solving problems and performing tasks.

In [[psychology]], the term ''mental models'' is sometimes used to refer to [[mental representation]]s or mental simulation generally. The concepts of [[schema (psychology)|schema]] and [[conceptual model]]s are cognitively adjacent. Elsewhere, it is used to refer to the [[Mental model theory of reasoning|"mental model" theory of reasoning]] developed by [[Philip Johnson-Laird]] and [[Ruth M. J. Byrne]].

==History==
The term ''mental model'' is believed to have originated with [[Kenneth Craik]] in his 1943 book ''The Nature of Explanation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nersessian|first1=Nancy J.|author-link=Nancy J. Nersessian|title=In the Theoretician's Laboratory: Thought Experimenting as Mental Modeling|journal=PSA: Proceedings of the Biennial Meeting of the Philosophy of Science Association|date=1992|volume=1992|issue=2|pages=291–301|url=http://www.cc.gatech.edu/aimosaic/faculty/nersessian/papers/in-the-theoreticians-laboratory.pdf|access-date=17 July 2014|quote=The contemporary notion that mental modelling plays a significant role in human reasoning was formulated, initially, by Kenneth Craik in 1943.|doi=10.1086/psaprocbienmeetp.1992.2.192843|s2cid=141149408}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Staggers|first1=Nancy|last2=Norcio|first2=A.F.|title=Mental models: concepts for human-computer interaction research|journal=International Journal of Man-Machine Studies|date=1993|volume=38|issue=4|pages=587–605|doi=10.1006/imms.1993.1028|url=http://userpages.umbc.edu/~norcio/papers/1993/Staggers-MM-IJMMS.pdf|quote=Although Johnson-Laird (1989) is generally credited with coining the term mental model, the history of the concept may be traced to Craik's (1943) work entitled ''The Nature of Explanation''.|access-date=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[:fr:Georges-Henri Luquet|Georges-Henri Luquet]] in ''Le dessin enfantin'' (Children's drawings), published in 1927 by Alcan, Paris, argued that children construct internal models, a view that influenced, among others, child psychologist [[Jean Piaget]].

[[Jay Wright Forrester]] defined general mental models thus:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The image of the world around us, which we carry in our head, is just a model. Nobody in his head imagines all the world, government or country. He has only selected concepts, and relationships between them, and uses those to represent the real system (Forrester, 1971).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Philip Johnson-Laird]] published ''Mental Models: Towards a Cognitive Science of Language, Inference and Consciousness'' in 1983. In the same year, [[Dedre Gentner]] and Albert Stevens edited a collection of chapters in a book also titled ''Mental Models''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lauradove.info/reports/mental%20models.htm "Mental models"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518220333/http://www.lauradove.info/reports/mental%20models.htm |date=2011-05-18 }}, report at www.lauradove.info.&lt;/ref&gt; The first line of their book explains the idea further: "One function of this chapter is to belabor the obvious; people's views of the world, of themselves, of their own capabilities, and of the tasks that they are asked to perform, or topics they are asked to learn, depend heavily on the conceptualizations that they bring to the task." (see the book: ''[[Mental Models (Gentner-Stevens book)|Mental Models]]'').

Since then, there has been much discussion and use of the idea in [[human-computer interaction]] and [[usability]] by researchers including [[Donald Norman]] and [[Steve Krug]] (in his book ''[[Don't Make Me Think]]''). [[Walter Kintsch]] and [[Teun A. van Dijk]], using the term ''situation model'' (in their book ''Strategies of Discourse Comprehension'', 1983), showed the relevance of mental models for the production and comprehension of [[discourse]].

[[Charlie Munger]] popularized the use of multi-disciplinary mental models for making business and investment decisions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqzcCfUglws "The Psychology of Human Misjudgement"], speech by Charlie Munger&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mental models and reasoning&lt;!-- [[#Mental models and reasoning]] above links to this heading --&gt;==
{{Main|Mental model theory of reasoning}}

One view of human reasoning is that it depends on mental models. In this view, mental models can be constructed from perception, imagination, or the comprehension of discourse (Johnson-Laird, 1983). Such mental models are similar to architects' models or to physicists' diagrams in that their structure is analogous to the structure of the situation that they represent, unlike, say, the structure of logical forms used in formal rule theories of reasoning. In this respect, they are a little like pictures in the [[picture theory of language]] described by philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] in 1922. [[Philip Johnson-Laird]] and [[Ruth M.J. Byrne]] developed their [[mental model theory of reasoning]] which makes the assumption that reasoning depends, not on logical form, but on mental models (Johnson-Laird and Byrne, 1991).

===Principles of mental models===
Mental models are based on a small set of fundamental assumptions ([[axiom]]s), which distinguish them from other proposed representations in the [[psychology of reasoning]] (Byrne and Johnson-Laird, 2009). Each mental model represents a possibility. A mental model represents one possibility, capturing what is common to all the different ways in which the possibility may occur (Johnson-Laird and Byrne, 2002). Mental models are iconic, i.e., each part of a model corresponds to each part of what it represents (Johnson-Laird, 2006). Mental models are based on a principle of truth: they typically represent only those situations that are possible, and each model of a possibility represents only what is true in that possibility according to the proposition. However, mental models can represent what is false, temporarily assumed to be true, for example, in the case of [[counterfactual conditionals]] and [[counterfactual thinking]] (Byrne, 2005).

===Reasoning with mental models===
People infer that a conclusion is valid if it holds in all the possibilities. Procedures for reasoning with mental models rely on counter-examples to refute invalid inferences; they establish validity by ensuring that a conclusion holds over all the models of the premises. Reasoners focus on a subset of the possible models of multiple-model problems, often just a single model. The ease with which reasoners can make deductions is affected by many factors, including age and working memory (Barrouillet, et al., 2000). They reject a conclusion if they find a counterexample, i.e., a possibility in which the premises hold, but the conclusion does not (Schroyens, et al. 2003; Verschueren, et al., 2005).

===Criticisms===
Scientific debate continues about whether human reasoning is based on mental models, versus formal [[rules of inference]] (e.g., O'Brien, 2009), domain-specific rules of inference (e.g., Cheng &amp; Holyoak, 2008; Cosmides, 2005), or probabilities (e.g., Oaksford and Chater, 2007). Many empirical comparisons of the different theories have been carried out (e.g., Oberauer, 2006).

==Mental models of dynamics systems: mental models in system dynamics==

===Characteristics===
A mental model is generally:
* founded on unquantifiable, impugnable, obscure, or incomplete facts;
* [[Cognitive flexibility|flexible]] – considerably variable in positive as well as in negative sense;

Mental models are a fundamental way to understand organizational learning. Mental models, in popular science parlance, have been described as "deeply held images of thinking and acting".&lt;ref&gt;"Leading for a Change", Ralph Jacobson, 2000, Chapter 5, Page102&lt;/ref&gt; Mental models are so basic to understanding the world that people are hardly conscious of them.

===Expression of mental models of dynamic systems===
S.N. Groesser and M. Schaffernicht (2012) describe three basic methods which are typically used:
* [[Causal loop diagram]]s – displaying tendency and a direction of information connections and the resulting causality and feedback loops
* System structure diagrams – another way to express the structure of a qualitative dynamic system
* Stock and flow diagrams - a way to quantify the structure of a dynamic system
These methods allow showing a mental model of a dynamic system, as an explicit, written model about a certain system based on internal beliefs. Analyzing these graphical representations has been an increasing area of research across many social science fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jones |first1=Natalie A. |last2=Ross |first2=Helen |last3=Lynam |first3=Timothy |last4=Perez |first4=Pascal |last5=Leitch |first5=Anne |title=Mental Models: An Interdisciplinary Synthesis of Theory and Methods |journal=Ecology and Society |date=2011 |volume=16 |issue=1 |doi=10.5751/ES-03802-160146|url=http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:271714/UQ271714_OA.pdf |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally software tools that attempt to capture and analyze the structural and functional properties of individual mental models such as Mental Modeler, "a participatory modeling tool based in fuzzy-logic cognitive mapping",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mentalmodeler.com/articles/Gray%20et%20al%20Mental%20Modeler%202013.pdf|title=Mental Modeler: A Fuzzy-Logic Cognitive Mapping Modeling Tool for Adaptive Environmental Management|website=mentalmodeler.com|access-date=28 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; have recently been developed and used to collect/compare/combine mental model representations collected from individuals for use in social science research, collaborative decision-making, and natural resource planning.

===Mental model in relation to system dynamics and systemic thinking===
In the simplification of reality, creating a model can find a sense of reality, seeking to overcome [[systemic thinking]] and [[system dynamics]].

These two disciplines can help to construct a better coordination with the reality of mental models and simulate it accurately. They increase the probability that the consequences of how to decide and act in accordance with how to plan.&lt;ref name="SUSM2004"/&gt;

* [[System dynamics]] – extending mental models through the creation of explicit models, which are clear, easily communicated and can be compared with each other.
* [[Systemic thinking]] – seeking the means to improve the mental models and thereby improve the quality of dynamic decisions that are based on mental models.

Experimental studies carried out in [[weightlessness]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author-link4=Francesco Lacquaniti |vauthors= McIntyre J, Zago M, Berthoz A, Lacquaniti F |year=2001 |title= Does the brain model Newton's laws? |journal=[[Nature Neuroscience]] |volume=4 |issue=7 |pages=693–694|doi= 10.1038/89477 |pmid= 11426224 |s2cid= 30444364 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and on Earth using [[neuroimaging]]

===Single and double-loop learning===
After analyzing the basic characteristics, it is necessary to bring the process of changing the mental models, or the process of learning. [[Learning]] is a back-loop [[wikt:process|process]], and [[feedback]] loops can be illustrated as: single-loop learning or double-loop learning.

====Single-loop learning====
Mental models affect the way that people work with information, and also how they determine the final decision. The decision itself changes, but the mental models remain the same. It is the predominant method of learning, because it is very convenient.

====Double-loop learning====
{{Main|Double-loop learning}}
Double-loop learning (''see diagram below'') is used when it is necessary to change the mental model on which a decision depends. Unlike single loops, this model includes a shift in understanding, from simple and static to broader and more dynamic, such as taking into account the changes in the surroundings and the need for expression changes in mental models.&lt;ref name="mild2003"/&gt;

{{Rhetoric}}
'''Informal fallacies''' are a type of incorrect [[argument]] in [[natural language]]. The source of the error is not just due to the ''form'' of the argument, as is the case for [[formal fallacies]], but can also be due to their ''content'' and ''context''. Fallacies, despite being incorrect, usually ''appear'' to be correct and thereby can seduce people into accepting and using them. These misleading appearances are often connected to various aspects of natural language, such as ambiguous or vague expressions, or the assumption of implicit premises instead of making them explicit.

Traditionally, a great number of informal fallacies have been identified, including the [[fallacy of equivocation]], the [[fallacy of amphiboly]], the [[Fallacy of composition|fallacies of composition]] and [[Fallacy of division|division]], the [[false dilemma]], the [[fallacy of begging the question]], the [[ad hominem fallacy]] and the [[appeal to ignorance]]. There is no general agreement as to how the various fallacies are to be grouped into categories. One approach sometimes found in the literature is to distinguish between [[fallacies of ambiguity]], which have their root in ambiguous or vague language, [[fallacies of presumption]], which involve false or unjustified premises, and [[fallacies of relevance]], in which the premises are not relevant to the conclusion despite appearances otherwise.

Some approaches in [[contemporary philosophy]] consider additional factors besides content and context. As a result, some arguments traditionally viewed as informal fallacies are not considered fallacious from their perspective, or at least not in all cases. One such framework proposed is the ''dialogical approach'', which conceives arguments as moves in a dialogue-game aimed at rationally persuading the other person. This game is governed by various rules. Fallacies are defined as violations of the dialogue rules impeding the progress of the dialogue. The ''epistemic approach'' constitutes another framework. Its core idea is that arguments play an epistemic role: they aim to expand our knowledge by providing a bridge from already justified beliefs to not yet justified beliefs. Fallacies are arguments that fall short of this goal by breaking a rule of [[Justification (epistemology)|epistemic justification]]. A particular form of the epistemic framework is the ''[[Bayesian epistemology|Bayesian]] approach'', where the epistemic norms are given by the laws of probability, which our degrees of belief should track.

The study of fallacies aims at providing an account for evaluating and criticizing arguments. This involves both a descriptive account of what constitutes an argument and a normative account of which arguments are good or bad.&lt;ref name="Walton" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Siegel" /&gt; In philosophy, fallacies are usually seen as a form of bad argument and are discussed as such in this article. Another conception, more common in non-scholarly discourse, sees fallacies not as arguments but rather as false yet popular beliefs.&lt;ref name="Hansen" /&gt;

== Traditional account ==
Informal fallacies are a form of incorrect [[argument]] in [[natural language]].&lt;ref name="Dowden"/&gt; An argument is a series of propositions, called the premises, together with one more proposition, called the conclusion.&lt;ref name="Engel1"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Engel |first1=S. Morris |title=With Good Reason an Introduction to Informal Fallacies |date=1982 |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/ENGWGR |chapter=1. Nature and scope of logic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walton"/&gt; The premises in correct arguments offer either deductive or defeasible support for the conclusion. The source of the error in incorrect arguments can be in the argument's ''form'', ''content'' or ''context''. If the error is only due to the ''form'', it is considered a formal fallacy. Informal fallacies may also include formal errors but they primarily involve errors on the level of ''content'' and ''context''.&lt;ref name="VleetIntro"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Vleet |first1=Van Jacob E. |title=Informal Logical Fallacies: A Brief Guide |date=2010 |publisher=Upa |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/VLEILF |chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fallacyfiles"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Fallacy Files: Informal Logical Fallacy |url=https://www.fallacyfiles.org/inforfal.html |website=www.fallacyfiles.org |access-date=20 March 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dowden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stump"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stump |first1=David J. |title=Fallacy, Logical |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/fallacy-logical |website=www.encyclopedia.com |access-date=20 March 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Korb"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Korb |first1=Kevin |title=Bayesian Informal Logic and Fallacy |journal=Informal Logic |date=2004 |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=41–70 |doi=10.22329/il.v24i1.2132 |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/KORBIL|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Informal fallacies are expressed in natural language. This brings with it various difficulties not faced when studying formal fallacies, like ambiguous terms, vague expressions or the premises being assumed implicitly rather than stated explicitly. Traditionally, a great number of informal fallacies have been listed, including the [[fallacy of equivocation]], the [[fallacy of amphiboly]], the [[Fallacy of composition|fallacies of composition]] and [[Fallacy of division|division]], the [[false dilemma]], the [[fallacy of begging the question]], the [[ad hominem fallacy]] or the [[appeal to ignorance]].&lt;ref name="Vleet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Engel"/&gt; The ''traditional approach'' tries to account for these fallacies using the concepts and theses discussed in this section.

=== Arguments and fallacies ===
Only arguments can constitute a fallacy. Various erroneous expressions do not count as fallacies because no argument is made, e.g. because no reasons are cited or no assertion is made.&lt;ref name="Engel1"/&gt; The core idea of arguments is that the premises support the conclusion or that the conclusion follows from the premises.&lt;ref name="Engel1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hansen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Walton"/&gt; Deductively valid arguments offer the strongest form of support: for them, it is impossible for the conclusion to be false if all the premises are true. The premises in non-deductive arguments offer a certain degree of support for their conclusion but they are defeasible:&lt;ref name="Engel1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mackie"/&gt; it is possible for all the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false. Defeasible arguments may still be rationally compelling despite being fallible, so they do not automatically constitute fallacies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tomić |first1=Taeda |title=False Dilemma: A Systematic Exposition |journal=Argumentation |date=2013 |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=347–368 |doi=10.1007/s10503-013-9292-0 |s2cid=144781912 |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/TOMFDA|url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt; The premises of an argument may be seen as the foundation on which the conclusion is built. According to this analogy, two things can go wrong and turn an argument into a fallacy. It could be that the foundation is shaky. But even a solid foundation is not helpful if it does not provide support for the conclusion in question.&lt;ref name="Engel1"/&gt;

Traditionally, fallacies have been defined by three necessary conditions: "a fallacy (i) is an argument, (ii) that is invalid, and (iii) appears to be valid."&lt;ref name="Hansen"/&gt; This definition covers only formal fallacy since it has deductive invalidity as a necessary condition. But it can easily be modified to include informal fallacy by replacing this condition with a more general term, like logical weakness or incorrect reasoning.&lt;ref name="Hansen"/&gt; The last clause includes a psychological element in referring to how the argument appears to the arguer. This clause is used to distinguish genuine fallacies from mere mistakes in reasoning, for example, due to carelessness.&lt;ref name="Hansen"/&gt; The idea is that fallacies have an alluring element that goes beyond mere carelessness by seducing us into committing the mistake, thereby explaining why they are committed in the first place. Some philosophers reject this appeal to appearances because the reference to psychology would complicate the investigation in various ways.&lt;ref name="Walton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hansen"/&gt; One issue is that appearances are different for different people. This problem also involves social studies in order to determine which reference group of people to consult for defining fallacies.&lt;ref name="Walton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hansen"/&gt; It has been suggested that, at its core, the study of fallacies is about normative aspects of arguments and not about their persuasive force, which is studied by empirical psychology instead.&lt;ref name="Walton3"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Walton |first1=Douglas N. |title=Informal Fallacies: Towards a Theory of Argument Criticisms |date=1987 |publisher=John Benjamins |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/WALIFT |chapter=3. Logic of propositions}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hansen"/&gt;

=== Form, content, and context ===
The source of the error in incorrect arguments can lie in the argument's ''form'', ''content'', or ''context''.&lt;ref name="fallacyfiles"/&gt; The ''form'' or structure of an argument is also called "[[rule of inference]]". The most well-known rule of inference is ''[[modus ponens]]'', which states that given a premise of the form "If ''p'' then ''q''" and another in the form "''p''", then the conclusion is "''q''". Rules of inferences are formal because it depends only on the structure or the syntax of the premises and not on their content. So an argument based on ''modus ponens'' is valid no matter what propositional contents are used for "''p''" and "''q''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lopez |first1=Shane J. |title=The Encyclopedia of Positive Psychology |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/LOPTEO-2 |chapter=modus ponens|year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''content'' of an argument is found on the level of its propositions: it is what is expressed in them. The source of many informal fallacies is found in a false premise. For example, a [[false dilemma]] is a fallacy based on a false disjunctive claim that oversimplifies reality by excluding viable alternatives.&lt;ref name="Mackie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dowden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Engel4"/&gt;

The ''context'' of an argument refers to the situation in which it is used.&lt;ref name="Hansen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Walton"/&gt; Based on its context it may be intended to play different roles. One way for an argument to be fallacious is if it fails to perform the role it was supposed to play. The [[strawman fallacy]], for example, involves inaccurately attributing a weak position to one's opponent and then refuting this position.&lt;ref name="Dowden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Walton"/&gt; The argument itself may be valid in that the refutation of the opposed position really is successful. The error is found on the level of the context since the opponent does not hold this position. This dependence on a context means that the same argument may be successful in another context: against an opponent who actually holds the strawman position.&lt;ref name="Walton"/&gt;

=== Natural language and contrast to formal fallacies ===
''Formal fallacies'' are [[Validity (logic)|deductively invalid]] arguments.&lt;ref name="Hansen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VleetIntro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fallacyfiles"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stump"/&gt; They are of special interest to the field of [[formal logic]] but they can only account for a small number of the known fallacies, for example, for [[affirming the consequent]] or [[denying the antecedent]]. Many other fallacies used in ''natural language'', e.g. in advertising or in politics, involve informal fallacies.&lt;ref name="Walton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Korb"/&gt; For example, [[false dilemma]]s or [[begging the question]] are fallacies despite being deductively valid. They are studied by [[informal logic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Honderich |first1=Ted |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |date=2005 |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/HONTOC-2 |chapter=logic, informal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mackie"/&gt; Part of the difficulty in analyzing informal fallacies is due to the fact that their structure is not always clearly expressed in natural language.&lt;ref name="Walton"/&gt; Sometimes certain keywords like "because", "therefore", "since" or "consequently" indicate which parts of the expression constitute the premises and which part the conclusion. But other times this distinction remains implicit and it is not always obvious which parts should be identified as the premises and the conclusions.&lt;ref name="Engel1"/&gt; Many informal arguments include enthymematic premises: premises that are not explicitly stated but tacitly presumed.&lt;ref name="Walton"/&gt; In some domestic quarrels and political debates, it is not clear from the outset what the two parties are arguing about and which theses they intend to defend. Sometimes the function of the debate is more to clarify these preliminary points than to advance actual arguments.&lt;ref name="Walton"/&gt;

The distinction between formal and informal fallacies is opposed by ''deductivists'', who hold that deductive invalidity is the reason for all fallacies.&lt;ref name="Jacquette"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jacquette |first1=Dale |title=Deductivism and the Informal Fallacies |journal=Argumentation |date=2007 |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=335–347 |doi=10.1007/s10503-007-9045-z |s2cid=124311289 |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/JACDAT-2|url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt; One way to explain that some fallacies do not seem to be deductively invalid is to hold that they contain various hidden assumptions, as is common for natural language arguments. The idea is that apparent informal fallacies can be turned into formal fallacies by making all these assumptions explicit and thereby revealing the deductive invalidity. The claim that this is possible for all fallacies is not generally accepted.&lt;ref name="Jacquette"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hansen"/&gt; One requirement for a formal treatment is translating the arguments in question into the language of formal logic, a process known as "formalization".&lt;ref name="Woods"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Woods |first1=John |last2=Walton |first2=Douglas |title=Fallacies |date=1989 |publisher=De Gruyter Mouton |isbn=978-3-11-081608-2 |url=https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9783110816082-019/html |language=en |chapter=Chapter 17. What is Informal Logic?|doi=10.1515/9783110816082-019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Often many of the subtleties of natural language have to be ignored in this process. Some bodies of knowledge can be formalized without much residue but others resist formalization. This is also true for many informal fallacies.&lt;ref name="Woods"/&gt;

== Contemporary approaches ==
The traditional approach to fallacies has received a lot of criticism in contemporary philosophy.&lt;ref name="Hansen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Korb"/&gt; This criticism is often based on the argument that some of the alleged fallacies are not fallacious at all, or at least not in all cases.&lt;ref name="Groarke"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Walton"/&gt; It is argued that the traditional approach does not fully consider the aim of an argument in a particular context, and a framework is required in order to show that, given their perspective, it is possible to evaluate if an alleged fallacy is actually fallacious in a given case.&lt;ref name="Hansen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Walton"/&gt; It has been suggested that there may not be one single framework for evaluating all fallacies but only a manifold of ideals according to which a given argument may be good or bad.&lt;ref name="Hansen"/&gt;

Two prominent frameworks which have been proposed are the dialogical and epistemic approaches. The dialogical approach uses a game-theoretic framework to define arguments and sees fallacies as violations of the rules of the game. According to the epistemic approach, it is the goal of arguments to expand our knowledge by providing a bridge from already justified beliefs to not yet justified beliefs. Fallacies are arguments that fall short of this goal by breaking a rule of epistemic justification.

=== Dialogical ===
The ''dialogical approach'' sees arguments not simply as a series of premises together with a conclusion but as a speech act within a dialogue that aims to rationally persuade the other person of one's own position.&lt;ref name="Hansen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Walton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Korb"/&gt; A prominent version of this approach is defended by [[Douglas N. Walton]]. On his [[game-theoretic]] conception, a dialogue is a game between two players.&lt;ref name="Hansen"/&gt; At the outset, each player is committed to a set of propositions and has a conclusion they intend to prove. A player has won if they are able to persuade the opponent of their own conclusion. In this sense, dialogues can be characterized as "games of persuasion".&lt;ref name="Walton"/&gt; The players can perform various moves that affect what they are committed to. In this framework, arguments are moves that take the opponent's commitments as premises and lead to the conclusion one is trying to prove.&lt;ref name="Walton"/&gt; Since this is often not possible directly, various intermediary steps are taken, in which each argument takes a few steps towards one's intended conclusion by proposing an intermediary conclusion for the opponent to accept. This game is governed by various rules determining, among other things, which moves are allowed and when.&lt;ref name="Walton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Walton3"/&gt; The dialogical approach makes it possible to distinguish between positive arguments, which support one's own conclusion, and negative arguments, which deny the opponent's conclusion.&lt;ref name="Walton"/&gt;

From this perspective, fallacies are defined as violations of the dialogue rules.&lt;ref name="Hansen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Walton3"/&gt; They are "deceptively bad argument[s] that impede the progress of the dialogue".&lt;ref name="Hansen"/&gt; The [[strawman fallacy]], for example, involves inaccurately attributing a weak position to one's opponent&lt;ref name="Dowden"/&gt; and then proving this position to lead to one's own conclusion. This mistake is not logical in the strict sense but dialogical: the conclusion may as well follow from these premises but the opponent does not hold these commitments.&lt;ref name="Walton"/&gt; In some cases, it varies from game to game whether a certain move counts as a fallacy or not. For example, there are cases where the [[tu quoque]] "fallacy" is no fallacy at all.&lt;ref name="Walton"/&gt; This argument, also known as ''appeal to hypocrisy'', tries to discredit the opponent's argument by claiming that the opponent's behavior is inconsistent with the argument's conclusion.&lt;ref name="Dowden"/&gt; This move does not necessarily break the rules of the dialogue.&lt;ref name="Walton"/&gt; Instead, it can reveal a weakness in the opponent's position by reflecting their criticism back onto them. This move shifts the burden of proof back to the opponent, thereby strengthening one's own position. But it still constitutes a fallacy if it is only used to evade an argument.&lt;ref name="Walton"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Walton |first1=Douglas N. |title=Informal Fallacies: Towards a Theory of Argument Criticisms |date=1987 |publisher=John Benjamins |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/WALIFT |chapter=1. A new model of argument}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Epistemic ===
The core idea behind the ''epistemic approach'' is that arguments play an epistemic role: they aim to expand our knowledge by providing a bridge from already [[Definitions of knowledge#Justified true belief|justified beliefs]] to not yet justified beliefs.&lt;ref name="Korb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Siegel"/&gt; Fallacies are arguments that fall short of this goal by breaking a rule of epistemic justification.&lt;ref name="Hansen"/&gt; This explains, for example, why arguments that are accidentally valid are still somehow flawed: because the arguer himself lacks a good reason to believe the conclusion.&lt;ref name="Korb"/&gt;

The fallacy of [[begging the question]], on this perspective, is a fallacy because it fails to expand our knowledge by providing independent justification for its conclusion. Instead, the conclusion is already assumed in one of its premises.&lt;ref name="Siegel"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Siegel |first1=Harvey |last2=Biro |first2=John |title=Epistemic Normativity, Argumentation, and Fallacies |journal=Argumentation |date=1997 |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=277–292 |doi=10.1023/A:1007799325361 |s2cid=126269789 |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/SIEENA|url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mackie"/&gt; A purely logical approach, on the other hand, fails to explain the fallacious nature of ''begging the question'' since the argument is deductively valid.&lt;ref name="Hansen"/&gt;

The [[Bayesian epistemology|Bayesian approach]] constitutes a special form of the epistemic approach.&lt;ref name="Hansen"/&gt; Bayesianism interprets degrees of belief as [[subjective probabilities]],&lt;ref name="Korb"/&gt; i.e. as the degree of certainty of the believer that the believed proposition is true. On this view, reasoning based on an argument can be interpreted as a process of changing one's degrees of belief, usually in response to new incoming information.&lt;ref name="Corner"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Corner |first1=Adam |last2=Hahn |first2=Ulrike |last3=Oaksford |first3=Mike |title=The Slippery Slope Argument – Probability, Utility &amp; Category Reappraisal |journal=Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society |date=2006 |volume=28 |url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/4m59x3cq |language=en |issn=1069-7977}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hansen"/&gt; Fallacies are probabilistically weak arguments, i.e. they have a low probability on the Bayesian model.&lt;ref name="Corner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hansen"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hansen |first1=Hans |title=Fallacies |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fallacies/ |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |access-date=18 March 2021 |date=2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether an argument constitutes a fallacy or not depends on the credences of the person evaluating the argument. This means that what constitutes a fallacy for one arguer may be a sound argument for another.&lt;ref name="Hansen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Korb"/&gt; This explains why, when trying to persuade someone, one should take the audience's beliefs into account.&lt;ref name="Hansen"/&gt; But it can also make sense of arguments independent of an audience, unlike the dialogical approach.&lt;ref name="Korb"/&gt;

This perspective is well suited for explaining why some [[slippery slope]] arguments constitute fallacies but others not. Slippery slope arguments argue against a certain proposal based on the fact that this proposal would bring with it a causal chain of events eventually leading to a bad outcome.&lt;ref name="Dowden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Korb"/&gt; But even if every step in this chain is relatively probable, probabilistic calculus may still reveal that the likelihood of all steps occurring together is quite small.&lt;ref name="Hahn"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hahn |first1=Ulrike |last2=Oaksford |first2=Mike |title=A Bayesian Approach to Informal Argument Fallacies |journal=Synthese |date=2006 |volume=152 |issue=2 |pages=207–236 |doi=10.1007/s11229-005-5233-2 |s2cid=31415386 |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/HAHABA-3|url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Korb"/&gt; In this case, the argument would constitute a fallacy. But slippery slope arguments are rationally justified if the associated probabilities are sufficiently high.&lt;ref name="Hahn"/&gt;

== Types ==
A [[List of informal fallacies|great variety]] of informal fallacies have been discussed in academic literature. There is controversy both concerning whether a given argument really constitutes a fallacy in all of its instances and concerning how the different fallacies should be grouped together into categories.&lt;ref name="Groarke"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Groarke |first1=Leo |title=Informal Logic: 4. Assessing Arguments |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-informal/ |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |access-date=20 March 2021 |date=2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hansen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Walton"/&gt; The categorization here follows proposals commonly found in the academic literature in these or similar terms.&lt;ref name="Engel"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Engel |first1=S. Morris |title=With Good Reason an Introduction to Informal Fallacies |date=1982 |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/ENGWGR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stump"/&gt; It distinguishes between [[fallacies of ambiguity]], which have their root in ambiguous or vague language, [[fallacies of presumption]], which involve false or unjustified premises, and [[fallacies of relevance]], in which the premises are not relevant to the conclusion despite appearances otherwise. Other categorizations have been proposed and some fallacies within this categorization could also be grouped in another category.&lt;ref name="Vleet"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Vleet |first1=Van Jacob E. |title=Informal Logical Fallacies: A Brief Guide |date=2010 |publisher=Upa |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/VLEILF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hansen"/&gt;

=== Fallacies of ambiguity ===
The source of the error for ''fallacies of ambiguity'' lies in the usage of language. This is due to the fact that many terms in natural language have ambiguous or vague meanings.&lt;ref name="Engel2"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Engel |first1=S. Morris |title=With Good Reason an Introduction to Informal Fallacies |date=1982 |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/ENGWGR |chapter=2. The medium of language}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mackie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stump"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Walton"/&gt; Ambiguous terms have several meanings while vague terms have an unclear meaning. Fallacies of ambiguity often result in merely verbal disputes: the arguing parties have different topics in mind and thereby talk past each other without being aware of this.&lt;ref name="Engel2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mackie"/&gt; One way to avoid or solve these fallacies is to clarify language, e.g. by committing to definitions and by introducing new distinctions.&lt;ref name="Engel3"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Engel |first1=S. Morris |title=With Good Reason an Introduction to Informal Fallacies |date=1982 |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/ENGWGR |chapter=3. Fallacies of ambiguity}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such reformulations may include a condensation of the original argument in order to make it easier to spot the erroneous step.&lt;ref name="Mackie"/&gt;

Fallacies of ambiguity are perhaps best exemplified by the [[fallacy of equivocation]], in which the same term appears with two different meanings in the premises,&lt;ref name="Engel3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stump"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hansen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Walton"/&gt; for example:
: Feathers are ''light''. ("light" as "not heavy")
: What is ''light'' cannot be dark. ("light" as "pale in color")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/light_2 |title=light_2 adjective - Definition, pictures, pronunciation and usage notes &amp;#124; Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary at |publisher=Oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com |date= |accessdate=2022-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: Therefore, feathers cannot be dark.
Equivocations are especially difficult to detect in cases where the two meanings are very closely related to each other.&lt;ref name="Mackie"/&gt;

The [[fallacy of amphiboly]] also involves ambiguity in meaning, but this ambiguity arises not on the level of individual terms but on the level of the sentence as a whole due to syntactic ambiguity,&lt;ref name="Engel3"/&gt; for example:
:"The police were told to stop drinking on campus after midnight.
:So, now they are able to respond to emergencies much better than before"&lt;ref name="Hansen"/&gt;
On one interpretation, the police are not allowed to drink alcohol. On another, it is now the job of the police to stop other people from drinking. The argument seems plausible on the former reading but fallacious on the latter reading.&lt;ref name="Hansen"/&gt;

The [[Fallacy of division|fallacies of division]] and [[Fallacy of composition|composition]] are due to ambiguity of the term "all" and similar expressions.&lt;ref name="Mackie"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mackie |first1=J. L. |title=Fallacies |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/fallacies |website=www.encyclopedia.com |access-date=19 March 2021 |date=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stump"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hansen"/&gt; This term has both a ''collective'' and a ''distributive'' meaning. For example, the sentence "all the citizens are strong enough to resist a tyrant" may mean either that all together are strong enough (collective) or that each one individually is strong enough (distributive).&lt;ref name="Mackie"/&gt; The ''fallacy of division'' is committed if one infers from the sentence in the collective sense that one specific individual is strong enough.&lt;ref name="Mackie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Engel3"/&gt; The ''fallacy of composition'' is committed if one infers from the fact that each member of a group has a property that the group as a whole has this property.&lt;ref name="Engel3"/&gt; For example, "[e]very member of the investigative team was an excellent researcher", therefore "[i]t was an excellent investigative team".&lt;ref name="Hansen"/&gt; Any form of fallaciously transferring a property from the whole to its parts or the other way round belongs to the category of ''fallacies of division and composition'', even when linguistic ambiguity is not the cause.

=== Fallacies of presumption ===
''Fallacies of presumption'' involve a false or unjustified premise but are often valid otherwise.&lt;ref name="Engel4"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Engel |first1=S. Morris |title=With Good Reason an Introduction to Informal Fallacies |date=1982 |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/ENGWGR |chapter=4. Fallacies of presumption}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stump"/&gt; This problematic premise can take different forms and the belief in it can be caused in different ways, corresponding to the various sub-categories in this field. These fallacies include the [[naturalistic fallacy]], the [[moralistic fallacy]] and the [[intentional fallacy]].&lt;ref name="Mackie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jacquette"/&gt;

A [[false dilemma]] is a fallacy of presumption based on a false disjunctive claim that oversimplifies reality by excluding viable alternatives.&lt;ref name="Engel4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mackie"/&gt; For example, a false dilemma is committed when it is claimed that "Stacey spoke out against capitalism, therefore she must be a communist". One of the options excluded is that Stacey may be neither communist nor capitalist. Our liability to commit false dilemmas may be due to the tendency to simplify reality by ordering it through either-or-statements.&lt;ref name="Engel4"/&gt;

For fallacies of generalization, the false premise is due to an erroneous generalization. In the case of the fallacy of [[sweeping generalization]], a general rule is applied incorrectly to an exceptional case. For example, "[e]veryone has a right to his or her property. Therefore, even though Jones had been declared insane, you had no right to take his weapon away."&lt;ref name="Engel4"/&gt;{{rp|147}} The generalization, in this case, ignores that insanity is an exceptional case to which the general rights of property do not unrestrictedly apply. [[Hasty generalization]], on the other hand, involves the converse mistake of drawing a universal conclusion based on a small number of instances.&lt;ref name="Engel4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stump"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Groarke"/&gt; For example, "I've met two people in Nicaragua so far, and they were both nice to me. So, all people I will meet in Nicaragua will be nice to me".&lt;ref name="Dowden"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dowden |first1=Bradley |title=Fallacies |url=https://iep.utm.edu/fallacy/|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |access-date=19 March 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Begging the question]] is a form of [[circular reasoning]] in which the conclusion is already assumed in the premises.&lt;ref name="Engel4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mackie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stump"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hansen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Walton"/&gt; Because of this, the premises are unable to provide independent support for the conclusion. For example, the statement "Green is the best color because it is the greenest of all colors", offers no independent reason besides the initial assumption for its conclusion. Detecting this fallacy can be difficult when a complex argument with many sub-arguments is involved, resulting in a large circle.&lt;ref name="Mackie"/&gt;

=== Fallacies of relevance ===
''Fallacies of relevance'' involve premises that are not relevant to the conclusion despite appearances otherwise.&lt;ref name="Mackie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stump"/&gt; They may succeed in persuading the audience nonetheless due to being emotionally loaded (for example: by playing on prejudice, pity or fear).&lt;ref name="Engel5"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Engel |first1=S. Morris |title=With Good Reason an Introduction to Informal Fallacies |date=1982 |url= https://philpapers.org/rec/ENGWGR |chapter=5. Fallacies of relevance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ad hominem]] arguments constitute an important class among the fallacies of relevance. In them, the arguer tries to attack a thesis by attacking the person pronouncing this thesis instead of attacking the thesis itself.&lt;ref name="Engel5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mackie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stump"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Groarke"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Walton"/&gt; Rejecting a theory in physics because its author is Jewish, which was common in the  [[Deutsche Physik|German physics community in the early 1930s]], is an example of the ad hominem fallacy. But not all ad hominem arguments constitute fallacies. It is a common and reasonable practice in court, for example, to defend oneself against an accusation by casting doubt on the reliability of the witnesses. The difference between fallacious and justified ad hominem arguments depends on the relevancy of the character of the attacked person to the thesis in question. The author's cultural heritage seems to have very little relevance in most cases for theories in physics, but the reliability of a witness in court is highly relevant for whether one is justified in believing their testimony. [[Whataboutism]] is a special form of the ad hominem fallacy that attempts to discredit an opponent's position by charging them with [[hypocrisy]] without directly refuting or disproving their argument.&lt;ref name=OLD&gt;{{citation |url= https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/whataboutism |title= whataboutism |work= [[Oxford Living Dictionaries]] |year=2017 |access-date=21 July 2017 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170309142742/https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/whataboutism |archive-date= 9 March 2017 |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] |url-status= dead |quote= Origin - 1990s: from the way in which counter-accusations may take the form of questions introduced by 'What about —?'. ...

This age-old technique, dubbed 'whataboutism', is in essence an appeal to hypocrisy; its only purpose is to discredit the opponent, not to refute the original argument.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Appeal to ignorance]] is another fallacy due to irrelevance.&lt;ref name="Engel5"/&gt; It is based on the premise that there is no proof for a certain claim. From this premise, the conclusion is drawn that this claim must therefore be false. For example, "Nobody has ever proved to me there's a God, so I know there is no God".&lt;ref name="Dowden"/&gt; Another version of the ''appeal to ignorance'' concludes from the absence of proof against a claim that this claim must be true.

[[Arguments from analogy]] are also susceptible to ''fallacies of relevance''. An [[analogy]] is a comparison between two objects based on similarity.&lt;ref name="Bartha"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mackie"/&gt; ''Arguments from analogy'' involve inferences from information about a known object (''the source'') to the features of an unknown object (''the target'') based on the similarity between the two objects.&lt;ref name="Bunnin"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bunnin |first1=Nicholas |last2=Yu |first2=Jiyuan |title=The Blackwell Dictionary of Western Philosophy |date=2009 |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-0-470-99721-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OskKWI1YA7AC |language=en |chapter=analogy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arguments from analogy have the following form: ''a'' is similar to ''b'' and ''a'' has feature ''F'', therefore ''b'' probably also has feature ''F''.&lt;ref name="Bartha"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bartha |first1=Paul |title=Analogy and Analogical Reasoning |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reasoning-analogy/ |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |access-date=21 January 2021 |date=2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sandkühler |first1=Hans Jörg |title=Enzyklopädie Philosophie |date=2010 |publisher=Meiner |url=https://meiner.de/enzyklopadie-philosophie.html |chapter=Analogie |access-date=2021-03-22 |archive-date=2021-03-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210311040207/https://meiner.de/enzyklopadie-philosophie.html |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The soundness of such arguments depends on the relevance of this similarity to the inferred feature.&lt;ref name="Salmon"&gt;{{cite book |last=Salmon |first=Merrilee |title=Introduction to Logic and Critical Thinking |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vd8JAAAAQBAJ |date=2012 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=978-1-133-71164-3 |pages=132–142 |chapter=Arguments from analogy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mackie"/&gt; Without this relevance, the argument constitutes a faulty or [[false analogy]], for example: "If a child gets a new toy he or she will want to play with it; So, if a nation gets new weapons, it will want to use them".&lt;ref name="Hansen"/&gt;

'''Market moving information''' is a term used in [[stock market]] investing, defined as information that would cause any reasonable investor to make a buy or sell decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|ssrn = 2579510|title = Reasonable Investor(s)|date = 2015|journal = Boston University Law Review|last1 = Lin|first1 = Tom C. W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also sometimes referred to as [[material information]].

When a public company insider fails to publicly disclose material, market moving information to everyone and only to certain parties, that is called [[selective disclosure]], an act that is prohibited by the [[Securities Exchange Commission]]'s [[Regulation FD]].

Many types of events can be considered market moving information.  A bad freeze in Florida can cause the price of orange juice to increase. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Micahel |first1=John |title=Umzug Regional |url=https://www.dortmundumzuege.de/ |access-date=19 April 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; An expected drought in the Midwest might cause corn or soybean prices to rise on fears of poor crop outputs and limited supplies. Statements by certain figures might also be market moving information. For instance, [[Elon Musk]] was fined by the SEC in 2018 for tweeting that he had secured investment funding sufficient to take [[Tesla, Inc.]] private, causing wild swings in the company's stock price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Elon Musk tweet wipes $14bn off Tesla's value |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52504187?fbclid=IwAR2ik5cXAZ-cUOYXU1_H59NgsHEOsRRpbsawX1PE6scWslQeMNPdDN-o23I |access-date=2 May 2020 |work=BBC News |date=1 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''price signal''' is [[information]] conveyed to [[consumer]]s and [[production (economics)|producer]]s, via the [[price]]s offered or requested for, and the [[Market depth|amount]] requested or offered of a [[product (business)|product]] or service, which provides a signal to increase or decrease quantity supplied or quantity demanded. It also provides potential [[business opportunities]]. When a certain kind of product is in shortage supply and the price rises, people will pay more attention to and produce this kind of product. The information carried by prices is an essential function in the fundamental coordination of an economic system, coordinating things such as what has to be produced, how to produce it and what resources to use in its production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

|encyclopedia=The Concise Encyclopedia of Economics
|publisher=Library of Economics and Liberty (econlib.org)
|access-date=18 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[neoclassical economics|mainstream (neoclassical) economics]], under [[perfect competition]] [[relative prices]] signal to producers and consumers what [[production (economics)|production]] or [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] decisions will contribute to [[allocative efficiency]]. According to [[Friedrich Hayek]], in a system in which the knowledge of the relevant facts is dispersed among many people, prices can act to coordinate the separate actions of different people in the same way as subjective values help the individual to coordinate the parts of his plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hayek |first1=Friedrich |title=The use of knowledge in society |journal=American Economic Review |date=1945 |volume=XXXV |issue=4 |pages=519–530 |jstor=1809376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pricing power ==
Alternative theories include that prices reflect relative [[pricing power]] of producers and consumers. A [[monopoly]] may set prices so as to maximize [[monopoly profit]], while a [[cartel]] may engage in [[price fixing]]. Conversely, on the consumer side, a [[monopsony]] may negotiate or demand prices that do not reflect the cost of production. The [[pricing power]] owned by an enterprise reflects the position of its products in the market. In this case, the price signal may no longer be able to affect such products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2013-01-09|title=Cartels |url=https://www.accc.gov.au/business/anti-competitive-behaviour/cartels|access-date=2021-04-25|website=Australian Competition and Consumer Commission|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Value ==
{{main|Theory of value (economics)}}
A long thread in economics (from Aristotle to classical economics to the present) distinguishes between exchange value, use value, price, and (sometimes) intrinsic value. It is frequently argued that the connection between price and other types of value is not as direct as suggested in the theory of price signals, other considerations playing a part.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Schroeder|first=Mark|title=Value Theory|date=2016|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2016/entries/value-theory/|encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2016|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2020-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Speculation ==
Financial [[speculation]], particularly buying or selling assets with borrowed money, can move prices away from their [[fundamental analysis|economic fundamentals]]. [[Credit bubble]]s can sometimes distort the price signal mechanism, causing large-scale malinvestment and [[financial crises]]. Adherents of the [[Austrian Economics|Austrian school of economics]] attribute this phenomenon to the interference of [[central bank]]ers, which they propose to eliminate by introducing [[full-reserve banking]]. By contrast, [[Post-Keynesian economics|post-Keynesian economists]] such as [[Hyman Minsky]] have described it as a fundamental flaw of [[capitalism]], corrected by [[financial regulation]]. Both schools have been the subject of renewed attention in the Western world since the [[2008 financial crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;Gopinath, Gita (April 14, 2020).

{{Distinguish|Theory of computation|Pancomputationalism}}

In [[philosophy of mind]], the '''computational theory of mind''' ('''CTM'''), also known as '''computationalism''', is a family of views that hold that the human [[mind]] is an information processing system and that cognition and consciousness together are a form of [[computation]]. It is closely related to [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]], a broader theory that defines mental states by what they do rather than what they are made of.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Functionalism |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/functionalism/ |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|date=2023 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Warren McCulloch]] and [[Walter Pitts]] (1943) were the first to suggest that neural activity is computational. They argued that neural computations explain [[cognition]].&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Piccinini |first=Gualtiero |last2=Bahar |first2=Sonya |date=2013 |title=Neural Computation and the Computational Theory of Cognition |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cogs.12012 |journal=Cognitive Science |language=en |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=453–488 |doi=10.1111/cogs.12012 |issn=1551-6709}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory was proposed in its modern form by [[Hilary Putnam]] in 1960 and 1961,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Horst |first=Steven |date=1999 |title=Symbols and Computation A Critique of the Computational Theory of Mind |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1008351818306 |journal=Minds and Machines |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=347–381 |doi=10.1023/A:1008351818306|url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then developed by his PhD student, philosopher, and cognitive scientist [[Jerry Fodor]] in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, Hilary, 1961. "Brains and Behavior", originally read as part of the program of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Section L (History and Philosophy of Science), December 27, 1961, reprinted in Block (1983), and also along with other papers on the topic in Putnam, ''Mathematics, Matter and Method'' (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Computational Theory of Mind"&gt;Horst, Steven, (2005) [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computational-mind/ "The Computational Theory of Mind"] in ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt; It was later criticized in the 1990s by Putnam himself, [[John Searle]], and others.

The computational theory of mind holds that the human mind is a computational system that is realized (i.e. physically implemented) by neural activity in the brain. The theory can be elaborated in many ways and varies largely based on how the term computation is understood. Computation is commonly understood in terms of [[Turing machine]]s which manipulate symbols according to a rule, in combination with the internal state of the machine. The critical aspect of such a computational model is that we can abstract away from particular physical details of the machine that is implementing the computation.&lt;ref name="The Computational Theory of Mind"/&gt; For example, the appropriate computation could be implemented either by silicon chips or biological neural networks, so long as there is a series of outputs based on manipulations of inputs and internal states, performed according to a rule. CTM therefore holds that the mind is not simply analogous to a computer program, but that it is literally a computational system.&lt;ref name="The Computational Theory of Mind"/&gt;

Computational theories of mind are often said to require [[Representation (psychology)|mental representation]] because 'input' into a computation comes in the form of symbols or representations of other objects. A computer cannot compute an actual object but must interpret and represent the object in some form and then compute the representation. The computational theory of mind is related to the [[representational theory of mind]] in that they both require that mental states are representations. However, the representational theory of mind shifts the focus to the symbols being manipulated. This approach better accounts for systematicity and productivity.&lt;ref name="The Computational Theory of Mind"/&gt; In Fodor's original views, the computational theory of mind is also related to the [[language of thought]]. The language of thought theory allows the mind to process more complex representations with the help of semantics.

Recent work has suggested that we make a distinction between the mind and cognition. Building from the tradition of McCulloch and Pitts, the ''computational theory of cognition'' (CTC) states that neural computations explain cognition.&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com"/&gt; The computational theory of mind asserts that not only cognition, but also phenomenal consciousness or [[qualia]], are computational. That is to say, CTM entails CTC. While phenomenal consciousness could fulfill some other functional role, computational theory of cognition leaves open the possibility that some aspects of the mind could be non-computational. CTC, therefore, provides an important explanatory framework for understanding neural networks, while avoiding counter-arguments that center around phenomenal consciousness.

=="Computer metaphor"==
Computational theory of mind is not the same as the computer metaphor, comparing the mind to a modern-day digital computer.&lt;ref name="BS"&gt;[[Steven Pinker|Pinker, Steven]]. [[The Blank Slate]]. New York: Penguin. 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Computational theory just uses some of the same principles as those found in digital computing.&lt;ref name="BS" /&gt; While the computer metaphor draws an analogy between the mind as software and the brain as hardware, CTM is the claim that the mind is a computational system. More specifically, it states that a computational simulation of a mind is sufficient for the actual presence of a mind, and that a mind truly can be simulated computationally.

'Computational system' is not meant to mean a modern-day electronic computer. Rather, a computational system is a symbol manipulator that follows step-by-step functions to compute input and form output. [[Alan Turing]] describes this type of computer in his concept of a [[Turing machine]].

==Criticism==
A range of arguments have been proposed against [[Physicalism|physicalist]] conceptions used in computational theories of mind.

An early, though indirect, criticism of the computational theory of mind comes from philosopher [[John Searle]].  In his thought experiment known as the [[Chinese room]], Searle attempts to refute the claims that [[artificial intelligence|artificially intelligent agents]] can be said to have [[intentionality]] and [[understanding]] and that these systems, because they can be said to be minds themselves, are sufficient for the study of the human mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Minds, brains, and programs | year = 1980 | author = Searle, J.R. | journal = The Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 3 | issue = 3 | pages = 417–457| doi = 10.1017/S0140525X00005756 | s2cid = 55303721 | url = http://cogprints.org/7150/1/10.1.1.83.5248.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Searle asks us to imagine that there is a man in a room with no way of communicating with anyone or anything outside of the room except for a piece of paper with symbols written on it that is passed under the door.  With the paper, the man is to use a series of provided rule books to return paper containing different symbols.  Unknown to the man in the room, these symbols are of a Chinese language, and this process generates a conversation that a Chinese speaker outside of the room can actually understand. Searle contends that the man in the room does not understand the Chinese conversation.  This was originally written as a repudiation of the idea that computers work like minds.

Searle has further raised questions about what exactly constitutes a computation:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
the wall behind my back is right now implementing the [[WordStar]] program, because there is some pattern of molecule movements that is isomorphic with the formal structure of WordStar. But if the wall is implementing WordStar, if it is a big enough wall it is implementing any program, including any program implemented in the brain.&lt;ref name=Searle1992&gt;{{Citation
 | title =  The Rediscovery of the Mind
 | year = 1992
 | author = Searle, J.R.
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Objections like Searle's might be called insufficiency objections. They claim that computational theories of mind fail because computation is insufficient to account for some capacity of the mind. Arguments from qualia, such as Frank Jackson's [[knowledge argument]], can be understood as objections to computational theories of mind in this way—though they take aim at physicalist conceptions of the mind in general, and not computational theories specifically.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

There are also objections which are directly tailored for computational theories of mind.

Jerry Fodor himself argues that the mind is still a very long way from having been explained by the computational theory of mind. The main reason for this shortcoming is that most cognition is [[Abductive reasoning|abductive]] and global, hence sensitive to all possibly relevant background beliefs to (dis)confirm a belief. This creates, among other problems, the [[frame problem]] for the computational theory, because the relevance of a belief is not one of its local, syntactic properties but context-dependent. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fodor, J.|title=The Mind Doesn't Work That Way: The Scope and Limits of Computational Psychology|publisher=The MIT Press |year=2000|isbn=978-0-262-56146-4|url=https://archive.org/details/minddoesntworkth00camb}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Putnam himself (see in particular ''Representation and Reality'' and the first part of ''Renewing Philosophy'') became a prominent critic of computationalism for a variety of reasons, including ones related to Searle's Chinese room arguments, questions of world-word reference relations, and thoughts about the [[mind-body problem]]. Regarding functionalism in particular, Putnam has claimed along lines similar to, but more general than Searle's arguments, that the question of whether the human mind ''can'' implement computational states is not relevant to the question of the nature of mind, because "every ordinary open system realizes every abstract finite automaton."&lt;ref name=Putnam1988&gt;{{cite book|last=Putnam |first=H. |year=1988 |title=Representation and Reality |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |publisher=The MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-66074-7 |oclc=951364040}}&lt;/ref&gt; Computationalists have responded by aiming to develop criteria describing what exactly counts as an implementation.&lt;ref name=Chalmers1996&gt;

[[Roger Penrose]] has proposed the idea that the human mind does not use a knowably sound calculation procedure to understand and discover mathematical intricacies. This would mean that a normal [[Turing complete]] computer would not be able to ascertain certain mathematical truths that human minds can.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Penrose, "Mathematical Intelligence," in Jean Khalfa, editor, ''What is Intelligence?'', chapter 5, pages 107-136. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; However, the application of [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|Gödel's theorem]] by Penrose to demonstrate it was widely criticized, and is considered erroneous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=The Computational Theory of Mind |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computational-mind/#GodIncThe |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=2020 |quote=Various philosophers and logicians have answered the critique, arguing that existing formulations suffer from fallacies, question-begging assumptions, and even outright mathematical errors [...].

=== Pancomputationalism ===
CTM raises a question that remains a subject of debate: what does it take for a physical system (such as a mind, or an artificial computer) to perform computations? A very straightforward account is based on a simple mapping between abstract mathematical computations and physical systems: a system performs computation C if and only if there is a mapping between a sequence of states individuated by C and a sequence of states individuated by a physical description of the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ullian|first=Joseph S.|date=March 1971|title=Hilary Putnam.

[[Hilary Putnam|Putnam]] (1988) and [[John Searle|Searle]] (1992) argue that this simple mapping account (SMA) trivializes the empirical import of computational descriptions.&lt;ref name="Putnam1988" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smythies|first=J.

* [[Daniel Dennett]] proposed the [[multiple drafts model]], in which consciousness seems [[Arrow of time|linear]] but is actually blurry and gappy, distributed over space and time in the brain. Consciousness is the computation, there is no extra step in which you become conscious of the computation.
* [[Jerry Fodor]] argues that mental states, such as beliefs and desires, are relations between individuals and mental representations. He maintains that these representations can only be correctly explained in terms of a language of thought (LOT) in the mind. Further, this language of thought itself is codified in the brain, not just a useful explanatory tool. Fodor adheres to a species of functionalism, maintaining that thinking and other mental processes consist primarily of computations operating on the syntax of the representations that make up the language of thought. In later work (''Concepts'' and ''The Elm and the Expert''), Fodor has refined and even questioned some of his original computationalist views, and adopted LOT2, a highly modified version of LOT.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Jerry A.

* [[David Marr (psychologist)|David Marr]] proposed that cognitive processes have three levels of description: the ''computational level'', which describes what operations the system performs and why it performs them; the ''algorithmic level'', which presents the algorithm used for computing it; and the ''implementational level'', which describes the physical implementation of the algorithm postulated at the algorithmic level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=The Computational Theory of Mind |url=https://iep.utm.edu/computational-theory-of-mind/ |website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ulric Neisser]] coined the term ''cognitive psychology'' in his book with that title published in 1967. Neisser characterizes people as dynamic information-processing systems whose mental operations might be described in computational terms.
* [[Steven Pinker]] described language instinct as an evolved, built-in capacity to learn language (if not writing). His 1997 book ''[[How the Mind Works]]'' sought to popularize the computational theory of mind for wide audiences.
* [[Hilary Putnam]] proposed [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]] to describe consciousness, asserting that it is the computation that equates to consciousness, regardless of whether the computation is operating in a brain or in a computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Functionalism |url=https://iep.utm.edu/functism/#H3 |access-date=2025-06-06 |website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-sensitive information==

===Public information===

This refers to information that is already a matter of public record or knowledge. With regard to government and private organizations, access to or release of such information may be requested by any member of the public, and there are often formal processes laid out for how to do so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipc.on.ca/english/access-to-information/accessing-public-information/ "Accessing Public Information" Information and Privacy Commissioner, Ontario, Canada. Retrieved Feb. 11 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt; The accessibility of government-held public records is an important part of government transparency, accountability to its citizens, and the values of democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.democracyweb.org/accountability/principles.php |title="Accountability and Transparency: Essential Principles" Democracy Web. Retrieved Feb. 11, 2013. |access-date=2013-02-12 |archive-date=2023-11-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231118210825/https://www.democracyweb.org/accountability/principles.php |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Public records]] may furthermore refer to information about identifiable individuals that is not considered confidential, including but not limited to: [[census]] records, [[criminal records]], [[sex offender registry]] files, and [[voter registration]].

===Routine business information===

This includes business information that is not subjected to special protection and may be routinely shared with anyone inside or outside of the business.

==Types of sensitive information==
''Confidential information'' is used in a general sense to mean sensitive information whose access is subject to restriction, and may refer to information about an individual as well as that which pertains to a business.

However, there are situations in which the release of personal information could have a negative effect on its owner. For example, a person trying to avoid a stalker will be inclined to further restrict access to such personal information. Furthermore, a person's [[Social Security number|SSN]] or [[Social insurance number|SIN]], credit card numbers, and other financial information may be considered private if their disclosure might lead to [[crime]]s such as [[identity theft]] or [[fraud]].

Some types of private information, including records of a person's [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|health care]], education, and employment may be protected by [[privacy law]]s. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Rights (OCR) |first=Office for Civil |date=2008-05-07 |title=Your Rights Under HIPAA |url=https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-individuals/guidance-materials-for-consumers/index.html |access-date=2022-08-28 |website=HHS.gov |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unauthorized disclosure of private information can make the perpetrator liable for civil remedies and may in some cases be subject to criminal penalties.

Even though they are often used interchangeably, personal information is sometimes distinguished from private information, or [[personally identifiable information]]. The latter is distinct from the former in that Private information can be used to identify a unique individual. Personal information, on the other hand, is information belonging to the private life of an individual that cannot be used to uniquely identify that individual. This can range from an individual's favourite colour, to the details of their domestic life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commonsensemedia.org/educators/lesson/private-and-personal-information-3-5 "Private and Personal Information"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324163614/https://www.commonsensemedia.org/educators/lesson/private-and-personal-information-3-5 |date=2016-03-24 }} Common Sense Media Inc., 2013. Retrieved Feb. 9 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter is a common example of personal information that is also regarded as sensitive, where the individual sharing these details with a trusted listener would prefer for it not to be shared with anyone else, and the sharing of which may result in unwanted consequences.

===Confidential business information===

Confidential business information (CBI) refers to information whose disclosure may harm the business. Such information may include [[trade secret]]s, sales and marketing plans, new product plans, notes associated with patentable inventions, customer and supplier information, financial data, and more.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marsdd.com/articles/confidential-information-and-trade-secrets/ "Confidential information and trade secrets"] MaRS, Dec. 8 2009. Retrieved Feb. 9 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[TSCA]], CBI is defined as proprietary information, considered confidential to the submitter, the release of which would cause substantial business injury to the owner. The US EPA may as of 2016, review and determine if a company´s claim is valid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=US EPA |first=OCSPP |date=2015-04-22 |title=CBI Claims and Reviews Under TSCA |url=https://www.epa.gov/tsca-cbi/cbi-claims-and-reviews-under-tsca |access-date=2023-03-01 |website=www.epa.gov |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classified===
[[Classified information]] generally refers to information that is subject to special security classification regulations imposed by many national governments, the disclosure of which may cause harm to national interests and security. The protocol of restriction imposed upon such information is categorized into a hierarchy of classification levels in almost every national government worldwide, with the most restricted levels containing information that may cause the greatest danger to national security if leaked. Authorized access is granted to individuals on a [[need to know]] basis who have also passed the appropriate level of [[security clearance]]. Classified information can be reclassified to a different level or declassified (made available to the public) depending on changes of situation or new intelligence.

Classified information may also be further denoted with the method of communication or access. For example, Protectively Marked "Secret" Eyes Only or Protectively Marked "Secret" Encrypted transfer only. Indicating that the document must be physically read by the recipient and cannot be openly discussed for example over a telephone conversation or that the communication can be sent only using encrypted means. Often mistakenly listed as meaning for the eyes of the intended recipient only&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/eyes-only|title=Eyes-only}}&lt;/ref&gt; the anomaly becomes apparent when the additional tag "Not within windowed area" is also used.

==Legal protection from unauthorised disclosure==

===Personal and private information===

Data privacy concerns exist in various aspects of daily life wherever personal data is stored and collected, such as on the [[Internet privacy|internet]], in [[Medical privacy|medical records]], [[Financial privacy|financial records]], and [[Political privacy|expression of political opinions]]. In over 80 countries in the world, personally identifiable information is protected by [[information privacy law]]s, which outline limits to the collection and use of personally identifiable information by public and private entities. Such laws usually require entities to give clear and unambiguous notice to the individual of the types of data being collected, its reason for collection, and planned uses of the data. In consent-based legal frameworks, explicit consent of the individual is required as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdf.toronto.edu/~csc300h/winter/13/lectures/week2-privacy.pdf "Basic Privacy"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231113113045/http://www.cdf.toronto.edu/~csc300h/winter/13/lectures/week2-privacy.pdf |date=2023-11-13 }} (lecture).

The EU passed the [[General Data Protection Regulation]] (GDPR), replacing the earlier [[Data Protection Directive]]. The regulation was adopted on 27 April 2016. It became enforceable from 25 May 2018 after a two-year transition period and, unlike a directive, it does not require national governments to pass any enabling legislation, and is thus directly binding and applicable.&lt;ref name="BlackmerGDPR16"&gt;{{cite web

"The proposed new EU data protection regime extends the scope of the EU data protection law to all foreign companies processing data of EU residents. It provides for a harmonisation of the data protection regulations throughout the EU, thereby making it easier for non-European companies to comply with these regulations; however, this comes at the cost of a strict data protection compliance regime with severe penalties of up to 4% of worldwide turnover."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hyp.is/oExZ4PVtEeefHEPs4cEz6w/www.mlawgroup.de/news/publications/detail.php|title=New draft European data protection regime|date=February 2, 2012|website=[[Law Patent Group]]|access-date=January 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GDPR also brings a new set of "digital rights" for EU citizens in an age when the economic value of personal data is increasing in the digital economy.

In Canada, the [[Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act]] (PIPEDA) regulates the collection and use of personal data and electronic documents by public and private organizations. PIPEDA is in effect in all federal and provincial jurisdictions, except provinces where existing privacy laws are determined to be “substantially similar”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazette.gc.ca/archives/p1/2002/2002-08-03/html/notice-avis-eng.html#i10 "DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRY: PERSONAL INFORMATION PROTECTION AND ELECTRONIC DOCUMENTS ACT"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602071256/http://www.gazette.gc.ca/archives/p1/2002/2002-08-03/html/notice-avis-eng.html#i10 |date=2013-06-02 }} Canada Gazette, Apr. 03 2002.

Even though not through the unified sensitive information framework, the United States has implemented significant amount of privacy legislation pertaining to different specific aspects of data privacy, with emphasis to privacy in healthcare, financial, e-commerce, educational industries, and both on federal and state levels. Whether being regulated or self regulated, the laws require to establish ways at which access to sensitive information is limited to the people with different roles, thus in essence requiring establishment of the "sensitive data domain" model&lt;ref&gt;[http://mask-me.net/datamaskingwiki/wiki/35/sensitive-data-discovery "Sensitive Data Discovery"]&lt;/ref&gt; and mechanisms of its protection. Some of the domains have a guideline in form of pre-defined models such as "Safe Harbor" of HIPAA,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/special-topics/de-identification/index.html#standard |title = Methods for De-identification of PHI|date = 7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on the research of [[Latanya Sweeny]] and established privacy industry metrics.

Additionally, many other countries have enacted their own legislature regarding data privacy protection, and more are still in the process of doing so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationshield.com/intprivacylaws.html "International Privacy Laws "] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231202131505/https://informationshield.com/intprivacylaws.html |date=2023-12-02 }} InformationShield.

===Confidential business information===
The [[confidentiality]] of sensitive business information is established through [[non-disclosure agreements]], a legally binding contract between two parties in a professional relationship. NDAs may be one-way, such as in the case of an employee receiving confidential information about the employing organization, or two-way between businesses needing to share information with one another to accomplish a business goal. Depending on the severity of consequences, a violation of non-disclosure may result in employment loss, loss of business and client contacts, criminal charges or a civil lawsuit, and a hefty sum in damages.&lt;ref&gt;Niznik, J. S. [http://jobsearchtech.about.com/library/weekly/aa-nondisclosure-4.htm "Non-Disclosure Agreement"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116101232/http://jobsearchtech.about.com/library/weekly/aa-nondisclosure-4.htm |date=2013-01-16 }} About.com, 2002. Retrieved Feb. 9 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; When NDAs are signed between employer and employee at the initiation of employment, a [[non-compete clause]] may be a part of the agreement as an added protection of sensitive business information, where the employee agrees not to work for competitors or start their own competing business within a certain time or geographical limit.

Unlike personal and private information, there is no internationally recognized framework protecting [[trade secrets]], or even an agreed-upon definition of the term “trade secret”.&lt;ref&gt;Magri, K. A. [http://www.myersbigel.com/library/articles/InternationalAspectsofTradeSecret.pdf "International Aspects of Trade Secrets Law"] 1997. Retrieved Feb. 9 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; However, many countries and political jurisdictions have taken the initiative to account for the violation of commercial confidentiality in their criminal or civil laws. For example, under the US [[Economic Espionage Act of 1996]], it is a federal crime in the United States to misappropriate trade secrets with the knowledge that it will benefit a foreign power, or will injure the owner of the trade secret.&lt;ref&gt;104th US Congress.

[[Whistleblowing]] is the intentional disclosure of sensitive information to a third-party with the intention of revealing alleged illegal, immoral, or otherwise harmful actions.&lt;ref&gt;Morley, H., Cohen-Lyons, J.

Retrieved Feb. 9 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; There are many examples of present and former government employees disclosing classified information regarding national government misconduct to the public and media, in spite of the criminal consequences that await them.

[[Espionage]], or spying, involves obtaining sensitive information without the permission or knowledge of its holder. The use of spies is a part of national intelligence gathering in most countries, and has been used as a political strategy by nation-states since ancient times. It is unspoken knowledge in international politics that countries are spying on one another all the time, even their allies.&lt;ref&gt;Woolsey, R. J.

==Digital sensitive information==

[[Computer security]] is [[information security]] applied to computing and network technology, and is a significant and ever-growing field in computer science. The term [[computer insecurity]], on the other hand, is the concept that computer systems are inherently vulnerable to attack, and therefore an evolving arms race between those who exploit existing vulnerabilities in security systems and those who must then engineer new mechanisms of security.

A number of security concerns have arisen in the recent years as increasing amounts of sensitive information at every level have found their primary existence in digital form. At the personal level, [[credit card fraud]], [[internet fraud]], and other forms of [[identity theft]] have become widespread concerns that individuals need to be aware of on a day-to-day basis. 
The existence of large databases of classified information on computer networks is also changing the face of domestic and international politics. [[Cyber-warfare]] and [[cyber espionage]] is becoming of increasing importance to the national security and strategy of nations around the world, and it is estimated that 120 nations around the world are currently actively engaged in developing and deploying technology for these purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Brodkin, J. [http://www.networkworld.com/news/2007/112907-government-cyberattacks.html "Government-sponsored cyberattacks on the rise, McAfee says"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617091822/http://www.networkworld.com/news/2007/112907-government-cyberattacks.html |date=2013-06-17}} Networked World: Nov. 29 2007.

Philosophies and internet cultures such as [[open-source governance]], [[hacktivism]], and the popular hacktivist slogan "[[information wants to be free]]" reflects some of the cultural shifts in perception towards political and government secrecy. The popular, controversial [[WikiLeaks]] is just one of many manifestations of a growing cultural sentiment that is becoming an additional challenge to the security and integrity of classified information.&lt;ref&gt;Ludlow, P.

[[File:Origin histograma raw data.png|thumb|right|upright=1.3|The two columns to the right of the left-most column in this computerized table are raw data.]]

'''Raw data''', also known as '''primary data''', are ''[[data]]'' (e.g., numbers, instrument readings, figures, etc.) collected from a source. In the context of examinations, the raw data might be described as a '''raw score''' (after [[test score]]s).

If a scientist sets up a computerized [[thermometer]] which records the temperature of a chemical mixture in a test tube every minute, the list of temperature readings for every minute, as printed out on a spreadsheet or viewed on a computer screen are "raw data".  Raw data have not been subjected to processing, "cleaning" by researchers to remove [[outlier]]s, obvious instrument reading errors or data entry errors, or any analysis (e.g., determining [[central tendency]] aspects such as the [[arithmetic mean|average]] or [[median]] result). As well, raw data have not been subject to any other manipulation by a software program or a human researcher, analyst or technician. They are also referred to as ''primary'' data. Raw data is a relative term (see [[data]]), because even once raw data have been "cleaned" and processed by one team of researchers, another team may consider these processed data to be "raw data" for another stage of research.  Raw data can be inputted to a [[computer program]] or used in manual procedures such as analyzing [[statistics]] from a [[statistical survey|survey]]. The term "raw data" can refer to the [[Binary number|binary]] data on electronic storage devices, such as hard disk drives (also referred to as "low-level data").

== Generating data ==
Data has two ways of being created or made. The first is what is called 'captured data',&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Data Revolution|last=Kitchin|first=Rob|publisher=Sage|year=2014|location=United States|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is found through purposeful investigation or analysis. The second is called 'exhaust data',&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and is gathered usually by machines or terminals as a secondary function. For example, cash registers, smartphones, and [[Speedometer|speedometers]] serve a main function but may collect data as a secondary task. Exhaust data is usually too large or of little use to process and becomes 'transient' or thrown away.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Examples==
In [[computing]], raw data may have the following attributes: it may possibly contain human, machine, or instrument errors, it may not be validated; it might be in different area ([[colloquial]]) formats; [[Code|uncoded]] or unformatted; or some entries might be "suspect" (e.g., [[outlier]]s), requiring [[confirmation]] or [[citation]]. For example, a data input sheet might contain dates as raw data in many forms: "31st January 1999", "31/01/1999", "31/1/99", "31 Jan", or "today". Once captured, this raw data may be [[Data processing|processed]] stored as a normalized format, perhaps a [[Julian date]], to make it easier for computers and humans to interpret during later processing. Raw data (sometimes colloquially called "sources" data or "eggy" data, the latter a reference to the data being "uncooked", that is, "unprocessed", like a raw [[egg]]) are the data input to processing. A distinction is  made between ''data'' and ''information'', to the effect that information is the ''end'' product of ''data'' processing. Raw data that has undergone processing are sometimes referred to as "cooked" data in a colloquial sense.{{dubious|date=September 2016}}  Although raw data has the potential to be transformed into "[[information]],"  extraction, organization, analysis, and formatting for presentation are required before raw data can be transformed into usable information.

For example, a [[point-of-sale terminal]] (POS terminal, a computerized [[cash register]]) in a busy supermarket collects huge volumes of raw data each day about customers' purchases. However, this list of grocery items and their prices and the time and date of purchase does not yield much information until it is processed. Once processed and analyzed by a [[software program]] or even by a researcher using a pen and paper and a [[calculator]], this raw data may indicate the particular items that each customer buys, when they buy them, and at what price; as well, an analyst or manager could calculate the average total sales per customer or the average expenditure per day of the week by hour. This processed and analyzed data provides information for the manager, that the manager could then use to help her determine, for example, how many cashiers to hire and at what times.  Such ''information'' could then become ''data'' for further processing, for example as part of a predictive [[marketing]] campaign. As a result of processing, raw data sometimes ends up being put in a [[database]], which enables the raw data to become accessible for further processing and analysis in any number of different ways.

[[Tim Berners-Lee]] (inventor of the [[World Wide Web]]) argues that sharing raw data is important for society.  [http://www.w3.org/2009/Talks/0204-ted-tbl/#(34) Inspired] by [http://blog.okfn.org/2007/11/07/give-us-the-data-raw-and-give-it-to-us-now/ a post] by [[Rufus Pollock]] of the [[Open Knowledge Foundation]] his call to action is [http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/tim_berners_lee_on_the_next_web.html "Raw Data Now"], meaning that everyone should demand that governments and businesses share the data they collect as raw data. He points out that "data drives a huge amount of what happens in our lives… because somebody takes the data and does something with it." To Berners-Lee, it is essentially from this sharing of raw data, that advances in science will emerge. Advocates of [[open data]] argue that once citizens and civil society organizations have access to data from businesses and governments, it will enable citizens and NGOs to do their ''own'' analysis of the data, which can empower people and civil society. For example, a government may claim that its policies are reducing the [[unemployment rate]], but a [[poverty]] advocacy group may be able to have its staff [[econometrics|econometricians]] do their own analysis of the raw data, which may lead this group to draw different conclusions about the data set.

{{No inline|date=May 2025}}

The process of '''informational listening''' focuses on the ability of an individual to understand a speaker's [[message]].{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} It is a huge part of everyday life, and failing to understand the concept of informational listening can be very detrimental to one's [[quality of life]] and to their contribution to society.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Much of the listening people engage in on a regular basis falls under the blanket of listening for information. In the office, people listen to their superiors for instructions about what they are to do. At school, students listen to teachers for information that they are expected to understand for  quizzes and tests. In all areas of life, informational listening plays a huge role in [[human communication]].{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Potential hindrances==
When listening to a person's message, it is common to overlook aspects of the conversation or make judgments before all of the information is presented.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} This lack of effective [[Understanding|comprehension]] is detrimental to [[communication]] and is illustrated effectively by several specific obstacles. Chief among these obstacles are [[confirmation bias]]{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} and the vividness effect,{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} both of which distort the speaker's message by severely affecting the perception of a particular topic.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Confirmation bias===
Confirmation bias is the tendency to pick out aspects of a conversation that support one's own beliefs and values. This psychological process proves to have a detrimental effect on communication for several reasons.

First, confirmation bias tends to become involved in conversation before the speaker finishes his/her message.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} As a result, an opinion is formed without first obtaining all pertinent information.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} This, in turn, leads to uneducated thinking and fallacious judgments that could later affect others.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Second, confirmation bias detracts from a person's ability to be [[Open-mindedness|open-minded]].{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} For example, when listening to a statement, an individual may hear something at the beginning of the conversation that arouses a specific emotion. Whether this is anger or frustration or anything else, it could have a profound impact on that person's perception of the rest of the conversation.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} If they were to become angry about a statement the speaker made early in the conversation, they would likely be averse to accepting arguments presented later in the [[discourse]].{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

To combat this bias and its consequences, an individual must be aware of it and its effects.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} With this knowledge, an individual can learn to critically judge both sides of an argument before coming to a conclusion.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Vividness effect===
The vividness effect explains how vivid or highly graphic and dramatic events affect an individual's perception of a situation.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} This phenomenon has been amplified by the media in recent decades.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} With the use of media technology, graphic images can be used to portray an event. While this makes the process of receiving news easier and more enjoyable, it can also blow a situation out of proportion.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} One year after the [[Columbine High School massacre]], about 60 percent of the people who responded to a survey by ''[[USA Weekend]]'' said that they felt a shooting was likely at their own school.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} The reality was much different; in fact, the likelihood of a [[school shooting]] is negligible{{clarify|date=November 2014}} across America.

The vividness effect was only amplified by the media.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} It existed long before the advent of television or radio. When observing an event in person, an individual is automatically drawn toward the sensational or vivid aspects.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Thus, a person becomes quick to believe that all aspects of an event are bad if they only remember the vivid parts that offended them.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} To counter this, an individual must be aware of and deal with the inclination to the dramatic and offensive, act accordingly.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} One must resist the temptation to jump to conclusions and instead weigh all facts before judging.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Effective listening==
In addition to avoiding the two major mistakes listed above, there are things one must do to be a competent informational listener.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Memory===

To understand what is said in the present, one must remember what has been said before; and for the message to have impact, one must remember at least parts of it at some point in the future. The most obvious memory aid is simply taking notes, but it is also helpful to create a mental outline of the message as it is being heard.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Identification===

Identify the main point that the speaker is trying to bring across. When the main point has been deduced, one can begin to sort out the rest of the information and decide where it belongs in the mental outline.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}  Before getting the big picture of a message, it can be difficult to focus on what the speaker is saying, because it is impossible to know where any particular piece of information fits.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Questions===

It is usually helpful to ask oneself questions about the speaker's message.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} If the listener is mentally asking questions about what is being said, it is a good sign that he/she is actively involved in effective informational listening.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

In [[psychology]], the human mind is considered to be a '''cognitive miser''' due to the tendency of humans to think and [[problem solving|solve problems]] in simpler and less effortful ways rather than in more sophisticated and effortful ways, regardless of intelligence.&lt;ref name="Stanovich2009"&gt;{{cite book |last=Stanovich |first=Keith E. |author-link=Keith Stanovich |date=2009 |chapter=The cognitive miser: ways to avoid thinking |title=What intelligence tests miss: the psychology of rational thought |location=New Haven |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |pages=[https://archive.org/details/whatintelligence00stan/page/70 70–85] |isbn=9780300123852 |oclc=216936066 }} See also other chapters in the same book: "Framing and the cognitive miser" (chapter 7); "A different pitfall of the cognitive miser: thinking a lot, but losing" (chapter 9).&lt;/ref&gt; Just as a [[miser]] seeks to avoid spending money, the human mind often seeks to avoid spending cognitive effort. The cognitive miser theory is an umbrella theory of [[cognition]] that brings together previous research on [[heuristic]]s and [[attributional bias]]es to explain when and why people are cognitive misers.&lt;ref name="Fiske&amp;Taylor1991"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fiske |first1=Susan T. |author-link1=Susan Fiske |last2=Taylor |first2=Shelley E. |author-link2=Shelley Taylor |year=1991 |orig-year=1984 |title=Social cognition |url=https://archive.org/details/socialcognition0002fisk |url-access=registration |edition=2nd |location=New York |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |isbn=978-0070211919 |oclc=22810253}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ToplakWestStanovich2014"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Toplak |first1=Maggie E. |last2=West |first2=Richard F. |last3=Stanovich |first3=Keith E. |s2cid=53340418 |author-link3=Keith Stanovich |date=April 2014 |title=Assessing miserly information processing: an expansion of the Cognitive Reflection Test |journal=Thinking &amp; Reasoning |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=147–168 |doi=10.1080/13546783.2013.844729}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''cognitive miser'' was first introduced by [[Susan Fiske]] and [[Shelley Taylor]] in 1984, who wrote that "People are limited in their capacity to process information, so they take shortcuts whenever they can."&lt;ref name="Fiske&amp;Taylor1991" /&gt; It is an important concept in [[social cognition]] theory and has been influential in other social sciences such as economics and political science.&lt;ref name="Fiske&amp;Taylor1991"/&gt;

== Assumption ==
The metaphor of the cognitive miser assumes that the human mind is limited in time, knowledge, attention, and cognitive resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Simon | first=H. A. | title=Rational choice and the structure of the environment. | journal=Psychological Review | publisher=American Psychological Association (APA) | volume=63 | issue=2 | year=1956 | issn=1939-1471 | doi=10.1037/h0042769 | pages=129–138| pmid=13310708 | s2cid=8503301 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually people do not think rationally or cautiously, but use cognitive shortcuts to make inferences and form judgments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=How we know what isn't so: the fallibility of human reason in everyday life|last=Gilovich, Thomas.|date=2008|publisher=Free Press|oclc=700511906}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Human inference: strategies and shortcomings of social judgment|last=Nisbett, Richard E.|date=c. 1985|publisher=Prentice-Hall|isbn=0134451309|oclc=899043502|url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/humaninferencest0000nisb}}&lt;/ref&gt; These shortcuts include the use of schemas, scripts, [[Stereotype|stereotypes]], and other simplified perceptual strategies instead of careful thinking. For example, people tend to make correspondent reasoning and are likely to believe that behaviors should be correlated to or representative of stable characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Jones | first1=Edward E. | last2=Davis | first2=Keith E. | title=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology | chapter=From Acts To Dispositions The Attribution Process In Person Perception | publisher=Elsevier | year=1965 | volume=2 | issn=0065-2601 | doi=10.1016/s0065-2601(08)60107-0 | pages=219–266| isbn=9780120152025 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===The naïve scientist and attribution theory===
{{further|Attribution theory}}
Before Fiske and Taylor's cognitive miser theory, the predominant model of social cognition was the naïve scientist. First proposed in 1958 by [[Fritz Heider]] in ''The Psychology of Interpersonal Relations'', this theory holds that humans think and act with dispassionate [[rationality]] whilst engaging in detailed and nuanced thought processes for both complex and routine actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Heider |first=Fritz |author-link=Fritz Heider |year=1958 |title=The psychology of interpersonal relations |edition=1st |location=New York |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |isbn=978-0898592825 |oclc=225326}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, humans were thought to think like scientists, albeit naïve ones, measuring and analyzing the world around them. Applying this framework to human thought processes, naïve scientists seek the consistency and stability that comes from a coherent view of the world and need for environmental control.&lt;ref name="CrispTurner2014"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Crisp |first1=Richard J. |last2=Turner |first2=Rhiannon N. |year=2014 |title=Essential social psychology |edition=3rd |location=New York |publisher=[[SAGE Publications]] |isbn=9781446270769 |oclc=873005953}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2016}}

In order to meet these needs, naïve scientists make [[attribution (psychology)|attribution]]s.&lt;ref name="KassinFein&amp;Markus2016"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kassin |first1=Saul |author-link1=Saul Kassin |last2=Fein |first2=Steven |author-link2=Steven Fein |last3=Markus |first3=Hazel Rose |author-link3=Hazel Rose Markus |date=2016 |title=Social psychology |edition=10th |publisher=[[Cengage Learning]] |isbn=9781305580220 |oclc=952391832}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2016}} Thus, attribution theory emerged from the study of the ways in which individuals assess causal relationships and mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ross |first=Lee |author-link=Lee Ross |year=1977 |chapter=The intuitive psychologist and his shortcomings: distortions in the attribution process |editor-first=Leonard |editor-last=Berkowitz |title=Advances in experimental social psychology |volume=10 |pages=173–220 |location=New York |publisher=[[Academic Press]] |isbn=978-0120152100 |oclc=1283539}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the study of causal attributions, led by [[Harold Kelley]] and [[Bernard Weiner]] amongst others, social psychologists began to observe that subjects regularly demonstrate several attributional biases including but not limited to the [[fundamental attribution error]].&lt;ref name="JonesHarris67"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jones |first1=Edward E. |last2=Harris |first2=Victor A. |year=1967 |title=The attribution of attitudes |journal=[[Journal of Experimental Social Psychology]] |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=1–24 |doi=10.1016/0022-1031(67)90034-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of attributions had two effects: it created further interest in testing the naive scientist and opened up a new wave of [[social psychology]] research that questioned its explanatory power. This second effect helped to lay the foundation for Fiske and Taylor's cognitive miser.&lt;ref name="CrispTurner2014"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2016}}

=== Stereotypes ===
According to [[Walter Lippmann]]'s arguments in his classic book ''[[Public Opinion (book)|Public Opinion]]'',&lt;ref name="Lippmann-1922"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lippmann |first=W. |year=1922 |url=http://www.howardnema.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/lippmann.pdf |title=Public Opinion |publisher=Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co. }}&lt;/ref&gt; people are not equipped to deal with complexity. Attempting to observe things freshly and in detail is mentally exhausting, especially among busy affairs. The term stereotype is thus introduced: people have to reconstruct the complex situation on a simpler model before they can cope with it, and the simpler model can be regarded as a stereotype. Stereotypes are formed from outside sources which identified with people's interests and can be reinforced since people could be impressed by those facts that fit their philosophy.

On the other hand, in Lippmann's view, people are told about the world before they see it.&lt;ref name="Lippmann-1922" /&gt; People's behavior is not based on direct and certain knowledge, but pictures made or given to them. Hence, influence from external factors are unneglectable in shaping people’s stereotypes. "The subtlest and most pervasive of all influences are those which create and maintain the repertory of stereotypes."&lt;ref name="Lippmann-1922" /&gt; That is to say, people live in a second-handed world with mediated reality, where the simplified model for thinking (i.e., stereotypes) could be created and maintained by external forces. Lippmann suggested that the public "cannot be wise", since they can be easily misled by overly simplified reality which is consistent with their pre-existing pictures in mind, and any disturbance of the existing stereotypes will seem like "an attack upon the foundation of the universe".&lt;ref name="Lippmann-1922" /&gt;

Although Lippmann did not directly define the term ''cognitive miser'', stereotypes have important functions in simplifying people's thinking process. As cognitive simplification, it is useful for realistic economic management, otherwise people will be overwhelmed by the complexity of the real rationales. Stereotype, as a phenomenon, has become a standard topic in sociology and social psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author1=Jones, E. E. |author2=Colman, A. M. |year=1996 |title=Stereotypes |editor1=A. Kuper |editor2=J. Kuper |encyclopedia=The social science encyclopedia |edition=2nd |pages=843–844 |location=London |publisher=Routledge }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heuristics===
Much of the cognitive miser theory is built upon work done on [[heuristics in judgment and decision-making]],&lt;ref name=BaroneMadduxSnyder1997&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barone |first1=David F. |last2=Maddux |first2=James E. |last3=Snyder, Charles R. |author-link3=Charles R.

* [[representativeness heuristic]] (the inclination to assign specific attributes to an individual the more he/she matches the prototype of that group).&lt;ref name="Kahneman&amp;Tversky1973" /&gt;
* [[availability heuristic]] (the inclination to judge the likelihood of something occurring because of the ease of thinking of examples of that event occurring)&lt;ref name="CrispTurner2014" /&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2016}}&lt;ref name="Kahneman&amp;Tversky1973" /&gt; 
* [[anchoring]] and adjustment heuristic (the inclination to overweight the importance and influence of an initial piece of information,  and then adjusting one's answer away from this anchor).&lt;ref name="Tversky&amp;Kahneman1974" /&gt;

The frequency with which Kahneman and Tversky and other attribution researchers found the individuals employed mental shortcuts to make decisions and assessments laid important groundwork for the overarching idea that individuals and their minds act efficiently instead of analytically.&lt;ref name="BaroneMadduxSnyder1997" /&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2016}}

==Cognitive miser theory==
The wave of research on attributional biases done by Kahneman, Tversky and others effectively ended the dominance of Heider's naïve scientist within social psychology.&lt;ref name="BaroneMadduxSnyder1997"/&gt; Fiske and Taylor, building upon the prevalence of heuristics in human cognition, offered their theory of the cognitive miser. It is, in many ways, a unifying theory of ad-hoc decision-making which suggests that humans engage in economically prudent thought processes instead of acting like scientists who rationally weigh cost and benefit data, test hypotheses, and update expectations based upon the results of the discrete experiments that are our everyday actions.&lt;ref name="Fiske&amp;Taylor1991"/&gt; In other words, humans are more inclined to act as cognitive misers using mental short cuts to make assessments and decisions regarding issues and ideas about which they know very little, including issues of great salience. Fiske and Taylor argue that it is rational to act as a cognitive miser due to the sheer volume and intensity of information and stimuli humans intake.&lt;ref name="Fiske&amp;Taylor1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scheufele-2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scheufele |first1=Dietram A. |last2=Lewenstein |first2=Bruce V. |title=The public and nanotechnology: how citizens make sense of emerging technologies |journal=Journal of Nanoparticle Research |date=17 May 2005 |volume=7 |issue=6 |pages=659–667 [660] |doi=10.1007/s11051-005-7526-2|bibcode=2005JNR.....7..659S |s2cid=136549696 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the limited information processing capabilities of individuals, people try to adopt strategies that economise complex problems. Cognitive misers usually act in two ways: by disregarding part of the information to reduce their own cognitive load, or by overusing some kind of information to avoid the burden of finding and processing more information.

Other psychologists also argue that the cognitively miserly tendency of humans is a primary reason why "humans are often less than rational".&lt;ref name="ToplakWestStanovich2014" /&gt; This view holds that evolution has made the brain's allocation and use of cognitive resources extremely embarrassing. The basic principle is to save mental energy as much as possible, even when it is required to "use your head".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and selection: essays on biological evolution and the philosophy of science|last=Hull, David L.|date=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0521643392 |oclc=876723188 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/scienceselection0000hull}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unless the cognitive environment meets certain criteria, we will, by default, try to avoid thinking as much as possible.

==Implications==
The implications of this theory raise important questions about both [[cognition]] and [[human behavior]]. In addition to streamlining cognition in complicated, analytical tasks, the cognitive miser approach is also used when dealing with unfamiliar issues and issues of great importance.&lt;ref name="Fiske&amp;Taylor1991" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Scheufele-2005" /&gt;

=== Politics ===
Voting behavior in democracies are an arena in which the cognitive miser is at work. Acting as a cognitive miser should lead those with expertise in an area to more efficient [[information processing (psychology)|information processing]] and streamlined decision making.&lt;ref name="LauRedlawsk2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lau |first=Richard R. |author2=David P. Redlawsk |title=Advantages and disadvantages of cognitive heuristics in political decision making |journal=[[American Journal of Political Science]] |date=4 Oct 2001 |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=951–971 |jstor=2669334 |doi=10.2307/2669334|citeseerx=10.1.1.609.340 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as Lau and Redlawsk note, acting as cognitive miser who employs heuristics can have very different results for high-information and [[low-information voter]]s. They write, "...cognitive heuristics are at times employed by almost all voters, and that they are particularly likely to be used when the choice situation facing voters is complex... heuristic use generally increases the probability of a correct vote by political experts but decreases the probability of a correct vote by novices."&lt;ref name="LauRedlawsk2001" /&gt; In democracies, where no vote is weighted more or less because of the expertise behind its casting, low-information voters, acting as cognitive misers, can have broad and potentially deleterious choices for a society.&lt;ref name="LauRedlawsk2001" /&gt;

Samuel Popkin argues that voters make rational choices by using information shortcuts that they receive during campaigns, usually using something akin to a [[Streetlight effect|drunkard's search]]. Voters use small amounts of personal information to construct a narrative about candidates. Essentially, they ask themselves this: "Based on what I know about the candidate personally, what is the probability that this presidential candidate was a good governor? What is the probability that he will be a good president?" Popkin's analysis is based on one main premise: voters use low information rationality gained in their daily lives, through the media and through personal interactions, to evaluate candidates and facilitate electoral choices.&lt;ref name="popkin"&gt;{{cite book|last=Popkin|first=Samuel|title=The Reasoning Voter|year=1991|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, IL|isbn=0226675440|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fAT-IREgyQ8C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economics ===
Cognitive misers could also be one of the contributors to the [[prisoner's dilemma]] in [[game theory]]. To save cognitive energy, cognitive misers tend to assume that other people are similar to themselves. That is, habitual cooperators assume most of the others as cooperators, and habitual defectors assume most of the others as defectors. Experimental research has shown that since cooperators offer to play more often, and fellow cooperators will also more often accept their offer, cooperators would have a higher expected payoff compared with defectors when certain boundary conditions are met.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Orbell|first1=John|last2=Dawes|first2=Robyn M.|date=June 1991|title=A 'Cognitive Miser' Theory of Cooperators Advantage|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=85|issue=2|pages=515–528|doi=10.2307/1963172|issn=0003-0554|jstor=1963172|s2cid=145799460 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mass communication ===
Lack of public support towards emerging techniques are commonly attributed to lack of relevant information and the low scientific literacy among the public. Known as the [[knowledge deficit model]], this point of view is based on idealistic assumptions that education for science literacy could increase public support of science, and the focus of science communication should be increasing scientific understanding among lay public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|date=1996|editor-last=Irwin|editor-first=Alan|editor2-last=Wynne |editor2-first=Brian|title=Misunderstanding science? |publisher=Cambridge University Press |doi=10.1017/cbo9780511563737|isbn=9780521432689}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Marks|first=Nicola J|chapter=Public Understanding of Genetics: The Deficit Model|date=2016-11-15|pages=1–5|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|isbn=9780470015902|doi=10.1002/9780470015902.a0005862.pub3|title=eLS}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the relationship between information and attitudes towards scientific issues are not empirically supported.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Kellstedt|first1=Paul M.|last2=Zahran|first2=Sammy|last3=Vedlitz|first3=Arnold|s2cid=8606155|date=February 2008|title=Personal Efficacy, the Information Environment, and Attitudes Toward Global Warming and Climate Change in the United States|journal=Risk Analysis|volume=28|issue=1 |pages=113–126 |doi=10.1111/j.1539-6924.2008.01010.x |pmid=18304110|bibcode=2008RiskA..28..113K |issn=0272-4332}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Scheufele | first=Dietram A. | title=Communicating science in social settings | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume=110 | issue=Suppl 3 | date=12 August 2013 | issn=0027-8424 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1213275110 | doi-access=free | pages=14040–14047| pmid=23940341 | pmc=3752169 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Low-information rationality}}&lt;!-- This anchor is used for the redirect "Low-information rationality". Please keep it at the beginning of the paragraph which first mentions low-information rationality. --&gt;Based on the assumption that human beings are cognitive misers and tend to minimize the cognitive costs, '''low-information rationality''' was introduced as an empirically grounded alternative in explaining decision making and attitude formation. Rather than using an in-depth understanding of scientific topics, people make decisions based on other shortcuts or heuristics such as ideological [[predistortion]]s or cues from mass media due to the subconscious compulsion to use only as much information as necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Popkin | first=Samuel | title=The reasoning voter: communication and persuasion in presidential campaigns | date=October 1991 | publication-place=Chicago | publisher=The University of Chicago Press | isbn=0-226-67544-0 | oclc=23082066 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scheufele-2023" /&gt; The less expertise citizens have on an issue initially, the more likely they will rely on these shortcuts.&lt;ref name="Scheufele-2023" /&gt; Further, people spend less cognitive effort in buying toothpaste than they do when picking a new car, and that difference in [[Information seeking|information-seeking]] is largely a function of the costs.&lt;ref name="Scheufele-2023"&gt;{{cite web |last=Scheufele |first=Dietram |title=Messages and Heuristics: How audiences form attitudes about emerging technologies |url=https://cspo.org/legacy/library/090423F3NZ_lib_ScheufeleDA2006M.pdf |accessdate=24 August 2023 |work=The Consortium for Science, Policy &amp; Outcomes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cognitive miser theory thus has implications for persuading the public: attitude formation is a competition between people's value systems and prepositions (or their own interpretive schemata) on a certain issue, and how public discourses frame it.&lt;ref name="Scheufele-2023" /&gt; Framing theory suggest that the same topic will result in different interpretations among audience, if the information is presented in different ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Scheufele | first1=Dietram A. | last2=Tewksbury | first2=David | title=Cadrage, programmes d'action et préparation: l'évolution de ces trois modèles d'effets des médias |language=fr |trans-title=Framing, agenda setting, and priming: The evolution of three media effects models | journal=Journal of Communication | publisher=Oxford University Press (OUP) | volume=57 | issue=1 | year=2007 | issn=0021-9916 | doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2006.00326_5.x | pages=9–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences' attitude change is closely connected with relabeling or re-framing the certain issue. In this sense, effective communication can be achieved if media provide audiences with cognitive shortcuts or heuristics that are resonate with underlying audience schemata.

=== Risk assessment ===
The metaphor of cognitive misers could assist people in drawing lessons from risks, which is the possibility that an undesirable state of reality may occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Risk Assessment in the Federal Government |author=US National Research Council Committee on the Institutional Means for Assessment of Risks to Public Health | publisher=National Academies Press | publication-place=Washington, D.C. | date=1983-01-01 | isbn=978-0-309-03349-7 | doi=10.17226/366 | pmid= 25032414 | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK216620/ | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; People apply a number of shortcuts or heuristics in making judgements about the likelihood of an event, because the rapid answers provided by heuristics are often right.&lt;ref name="Fiske&amp;Taylor1991" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marteau|first=T. M|date=1999-01-01|title=Communicating genetic risk information|journal=British Medical Bulletin|volume=55|issue=2|pages=414–428|doi=10.1258/0007142991902466|pmid=10723866|issn=0007-1420|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet certain pitfalls may be neglected in these shortcuts. A practical example of the cognitively miserly way of thinking in the context of a risk assessment of [[Deepwater Horizon explosion]],  is presented below.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/28/opinion/28brooks.html|title=Drilling for Certainty |type=Opinion |last=Brooks|first=David|date=May 27, 2010|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=Sep 16, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* People have trouble in imagining how small failings can pile up to form a catastrophe;
* People tend to get accustomed to risk. Due to the seemingly smooth current situation, people unconsciously adjust their acceptance of risk;
* People tend to over-express their faith and confidence in backup systems and safety devices;
* People regard complicated technical systems in line with complicated governing structures;
* When concerned with a certain issue, people tend to spread good news and hide bad news;
* People tend to think alike if they are in the same field (see also: [[Echo chamber (media)|echo chamber]]), regardless of their position in a project's hierarchy.

=== Psychology ===
The theory that human beings are cognitive misers, also shed light on the [[dual process theory]] in psychology. Dual process theory proposes that there are two types of cognitive processes in human mind. [[Daniel Kahneman]] described these as intuitive (System 1) and reasoning (System 2), respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kahneman | first=Daniel | title=A perspective on judgment and choice: Mapping bounded rationality | journal=American Psychologist | publisher=American Psychological Association (APA) | volume=58 | issue=9 | year=2003 | issn=1935-990X | doi=10.1037/0003-066x.58.9.697 | pmid=14584987 | citeseerx=10.1.1.186.3636  | pages=697–720| s2cid=16994141 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When processing with System 1, which starts automatically and without control, people expend little to no effort, but can generate complex patterns of ideas. When processing with System 2, people actively consider how best to distribute mental effort to accurately process data, and can construct thoughts in an orderly series of steps.&lt;ref name="Kahneman-2011"&gt;{{cite book | last=Kahneman | first=D. | title=Thinking, Fast and Slow | publisher=Penguin Books Limited | year=2011 | isbn=978-0-14-191892-1 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oV1tXT3HigoC | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two cognitive processing systems are not separate and can have interactions with each other. Here is an example of how people's beliefs are formed under the dual process model:

{{ordered list|list-style-type=upper-roman
|System 1 generates suggestions for System 2, with impressions, intuitions, intentions or feelings; 
|If System 1's proposal is endorsed by System 2, those impressions and intuitions will turn into beliefs, and the sudden inspiration generated by System 1 will turn into voluntary actions; 
|When everything goes smoothly (as is often the case), System 2 adopts the suggestions of System 1 with little or no modification. Herein there is a window for bias to form, as System 2 may be trained to incorrectly regard the accuracy of data derived from observations gathered via System 1.}}

The reasoning process can be activated to help with the intuition when:

* A question arises, but System 1 does not generate an answer
* An event is detected to violate the model of world that System 1 maintains.

Conflicts also exists in this dual-process. A brief example provided by Kahneman is that when we try not to stare at the oddly dressed couple at the neighboring table in a restaurant, our automatic reaction (System 1) makes us stare at them, but conflicts emerge as System 2 tries to control this behavior.&lt;ref name="Kahneman-2011" /&gt;

The dual processing system can produce cognitive illusions. System 1 always operates automatically, with our easiest shortcut but often with error. System 2 may also have no clue to the error.{{Clarify|reason=What does "no clue to the error" mean?|date=May 2022}} Errors can be prevented only by enhanced monitoring of System 2, which costs a plethora of cognitive efforts.&lt;ref name="Kahneman-2011" /&gt;

== Limitations ==

=== Omission of motivation ===
The cognitive miser theory did not originally specify the role of motivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social cognition: from brains to culture |last=Fiske |first=Susan T. |isbn=978-1473969292|oclc=968775128|date = 2017-03-15|publisher=SAGE Publications }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Fiske's subsequent research, the omission of the role of intent in the metaphor of cognitive miser is recognized. Motivation does affect the activation and use of stereotypes and prejudices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Fiske | first=Susan T. | title=Intent and Ordinary Bias: Unintended Thought and Social Motivation Create Casual Prejudice | journal=Social Justice Research | publisher=Springer Science and Business Media LLC | volume=17 | issue=2 | year=2004 | issn=0885-7466 | doi=10.1023/b:sore.0000027405.94966.23 | pages=117–127| s2cid=144716889 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Updates and later research==

=== Motivated tactician ===
People tend to use heuristic shortcuts when making decisions. But the problem remains that although these shortcuts could not compare to effortful thoughts in accuracy, people should have a certain parameter to help them adopt one of the most adequate shortcuts.&lt;ref name="Kruglanski-1994"&gt;{{cite book | last=Kruglanski | first=A. W. | chapter=The social-cognitive bases of scientific knowledge | editor-last=Shadish | editor-first=W.R. | editor-last2=Fuller | editor-first2=S. | title=The Social Psychology of Science | publisher=Guilford Publications | series=Conduct of science series | year=1994 | isbn=978-0-89862-021-4 | chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cWqqBT_AK-IC&amp;pg=PA197 | pages=197–213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kruglanski proposed that people are combination of naïve scientists and cognitive misers: people are flexible social thinkers who choose between multiple cognitive strategies (i.e., speed/ease vs. accuracy/logic) based on their current goals, motives, and needs.&lt;ref name="Kruglanski-1994" /&gt;

Later models suggest that the cognitive miser and the naïve scientist create two poles of social cognition that are too monolithic. Instead, Fiske, Taylor, and [[Arie W. Kruglanski]] and other social psychologists offer an alternative explanation of social cognition: the [[motivated tactician]].&lt;ref name="Fiske&amp;Taylor1991" /&gt; According to this theory, people employ either shortcuts or thoughtful analysis based upon the context and salience of a particular issue. In other words, this theory suggests that humans are, in fact, ''both'' naive scientists and cognitive misers.&lt;ref name="CrispTurner2014" /&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2016}} In this sense people are strategic instead of passively choosing the most effortless shortcuts when they allocate their cognitive efforts, and therefore they can decide to be naïve scientists or cognitive misers depending on their goals.

      <text bytes="15202" sha1="0gt876kf7z3mo73080c4nl4mw1ck4qn" xml:space="preserve">'''Informatization''' or '''informatisation''' refers to the extent by which a geographical area, an economy or a society is becoming information-based, i.e. the increase in size of its information labor force. Usage of the term was inspired by [[Marc Porat]]’s categories of ages of human civilization: the Agricultural Age, the Industrial Age and the Information Age (1978). Informatization is to the Information Age what industrialization was to the Industrial Age. It has been stated that:

:The Agricultural Age has brought about the agriculturization of the planet. The Industrial Age has caused among other things the industrialization of agriculture. The Information Age has resulted to the informatization of the agricultural industry (Flor, 1993).

The term has mostly been used within the context of national development. [[Everett Rogers]] defines informatization as the process through which new communication technologies are used as a means for furthering development as a nation becomes more and more an [[information society]].{{r|Rogers2000}} However, some observers, such as Alexander Flor ([[#Flor1986|1986]]) have cautioned about the negative impact of informatization on traditional societies.

Recently, the [[technological determinism]] dimension has been highlighted in informatization. [[Randy Kluver]] of Texas A&amp;M University defines informatization as the process primarily by which information technologies, such as the World Wide Web and other communication technologies, have transformed economic and social relations to such an extent that cultural and economic barriers are minimized. Kluver expands the concept to encompass the civic and cultural arenas. He believes that it is a process whereby information and communication technologies shape cultural and civic discourse.

[[G. Wang]] describes the same phenomenon (1994) which she calls "informatization" as a "process" of change that features (a) the use of informatization and IT (information technologies) to such an extent that they become the dominant forces in commanding economic, political, social and cultural development; and (b) unprecedented growth in the speed, quantity, and popularity of information production and distribution."

==Origin of the term==
The term informatisation was coined by Simon Nora and Alain Minc in their publication ''L'Informatisation de la société: Rapport à M. le Président de la République''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nora|first1=Simon|last2=Minc|first2=Alain|title=L'informatisation de la société|journal=La Documentation française|date=1978|pages=901|url=http://www.ladocumentationfrancaise.fr/rapports-publics/154000252/index.shtml|accessdate=23 February 2016|ref=nora-minc|isbn=2020049740}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was translated in English in 1980 as ''The Computerization of Society: A report to the President of France''.&lt;ref name="nora-minc-en"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nora|first1=Simon|last2=Minc|first2=Alain|title=The computerization of society : a report to the President of France0-262-64020-1|date=1981|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=0262640201|pages=208|edition=2. pr}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[#SAOUG|SAOUG]]) However, in an article published in 1987 Minc preferred to use informatisation and not [[Digital Revolution|computerization]].

After the 1978 publication the concept was adopted in French, German and English subject literatures and was broadened to include more aspects than only computers and [[telecommunication]]s ([[#SAOUG|SAOUG]]).

==Social impact==
Informatization has many far-reaching consequences in society. Kim ([[#Kim2004|2004]]) observes that these include repercussions in economics, politics and other aspects of modern living. In the economic sphere, for example, information is viewed as a focal resource for development, replacing the centrality of labor and capital during the industrial age. In the political arena, there are increased opportunities for participative democracy with the advent of [[information and communication technology]] (ICT) that provide easy access to information on varied social and political issues.

==In economic systems==
[[Industrialization]] propelled transformation of the economic system from agricultural age to modernized economies, and so informatization ushered the industrial age into an information-rich economy. Unlike the agricultural and industrial ages where economics refers to optimization of scarce resources, the information age deals with maximization of abundant resources. Alexander Flor ([[#Flor2008|2008]]) wrote that informatization gives rise to information-based economies and societies wherein information naturally becomes a dominant commodity or resource. The accumulation and efficient use of knowledge has played a central role in the transformation of the economy ([[#Linden2004|Linden 2004]]).

==Globalization==
Over the years, [[globalization]] and informatization have "redefined industries, politics, cultures, and perhaps the underlying rules of social order" ([[#Friedman|Friedman 1999]]). Although they explain different phenomena, their social, political, economic, and cultural functions remarkably overlaps. "Although globalization ultimately refers to the integration of economic institutions, much of this integration occurs through the channels of technology. Although international trade is not a new phenomenon, the advent of communications technologies has accelerated the pace and scope of trade" ([[#Kluver2008|Kluver]]).

::a) Globalization and Informatization will have great impact on cultural and social consequences of society.

::b) "Globalization and informatization are likely to diminish the concept of the national as a political institution" ([[#Poster|Poster 1999]]). Friedman ([[#Friedman|1999]]) argues that as nation states decline in importance, [[multi-national corporation]]s, [[nongovernmental organizations]], and "superempowered individuals" such as [[George Soros]] gain influence and importance. As these non-political organizations and institutions gain importance, there are inevitable challenges to political, economic, and cultural processes.

::c) On the other hand, globalization and informatization allow for efficient flow of information.  Individuals and societies are, therefore, greatly empowered to engage in international arena for economic, political, and cultural resources.

::d) "There is proliferation of information about lifestyles, religions, and cultural issues.  The telecommunications and computer networks also allow for unprecedented global activism.  This democratization of information increases the potential for international harmony, although it by no means guarantees it" ([[#Kluver2008|Kluver]]).

::e) These twin forces greatly affects "centuries of tradition, local autonomy, and cultural integrity."

::f) "Finally, one of the potentially most devastating impact of the forces of globalization and informatization is that there is created an insidious conflict between the new global economic order and the local, or even tribal, interests" ([[#Kluver2008|Kluver]]).

==Measurement==
Kim ([[#Kim2004|2004]]) proposed to measure the informatization in a country using a composite measure made up of the following extraneous variables: Education, R&amp;D Expenditure, Agricultural Sector and [[Intellectual Property]]. Kim also relates increasing democracy as evidence of social informatization.  It supposedly take into consideration the three approaches to conceptualizing informatization namely the economic, technological, and stock. Each can be measured with economic data (e.g. GDP), ICT data (e.g. number of computers per population), and amount of information (e.g. number of published technological journals) respectively.

Such composite measure is similar to the [[World Bank]]'s Knowledge Assessment Methodology (KAM) Variables ([[#Worldbank1|2008]]) which are clustered into: overall performance of the economy, economic incentive and institutional regime, innovation system, education and human resources, and information and communication technology.

===Difficulties with measurement===
The measurement for the level of informatization is an ongoing area of development. Among the issues are the ambiguity of the definition of "information" and whether this entity can be quantifiable in contrast to the tangible products of industrialization.

Taylor and Zang ([[#TaylorAndZang2007|2007]]) explored the issues behind the limitations of current theoretical models in terms of quantifying the positive impacts of ICT projects, and provided critiques of the information indicators used to gauge and justify informatization projects.

International organizations such as the United Nations, through its World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) and International Telecommunication Union (ITU); and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) also recognize this challenge and have initiated efforts to improve the methodologies for measuring an "information society".

==National laws==
Informatization is recognized by states as important to national development. Some states have created laws implementing or regulating informatization.

In [[Russia]] the State [[Duma]] enacted the ''Federal Law on Information, Informatization, and the Protection of Information'' on January 25, 1995. It was signed into law by President Boris Yeltsin on February 20, 1995.

[[Azerbaijan]] had a ''Law on Information, Informatization and Protection of Information'' in 1998.

== Through TV white space (TVWS) technology ==
TV white space refers to the unused TV channels between the active ones in the VHF and UHF spectrum. TV spectrum is commonly referred to as television "white spaces". TV white space can be used to provide broadband internet access, particularly in remote and rural areas (Edwards, 2016), and as such can serve as a tool for increasing information access and social and economic development. In 2008 The Federal Communications Commission voted to reallocate unlicensed white space spectrum for public use (White Space, n.d.)

"'''Bum steer'''", a term denoting misdirection, is predominantly from Australia, New Zealand and North America. The idiom means to provide information, intentionally or unintentionally,&lt;ref&gt;p.468, Urdang&lt;/ref&gt;  that is incorrect,&lt;ref&gt;for example, p.137, Kitching&lt;/ref&gt; was unhelpful, or caused one to be led astray.  The idiom, as used in Australia and New Zealand, reached the United States in the 1920s&lt;ref&gt;p.125, Barnhart, Steinmetz&lt;/ref&gt; probably after exposure to Australian troops on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] during [[World War I]], and is recorded in the UK since 1944.&lt;ref&gt;p.32, Fergusson, Partridge, Beale&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bum Steer.jpg|thumb|Sailors often misheard directions when attempting to steer the

]]
Its origin is possibly from 19th-century American maritime humour and the difficulty of trying to steer a vessel in reverse.&lt;ref&gt;p.1619, The Chambers Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;  A ship's stern is flat and lacks the pointed structure of a [[Bow (ship)|bow]], and a ship is therefore difficult to maneuver in reverse when using the [[rudder]], also found on the stern.&lt;ref&gt;p.73, Day&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=February 2019}} The reverse maneuvering was accomplished therefore through shouted instructions from the wharf to the [[Bridge (nautical)|wheelhouse]], via intermediary deckhands.  Such communication  was prone to misunderstanding owing to the wide variety of nationalities employed on United States merchant vessels during the 19th century.

'''Information''' is an [[Abstraction|abstract concept]] that refers to something which has the power [[Communication|to inform]].  At the most fundamental level, it pertains to the [[Interpretation (philosophy)|interpretation]] (perhaps [[Interpretation (logic)|formally]]) of that which may be [[sense]]d, or their [[abstraction]]s.  Any natural process that is not completely [[random]] and any observable [[pattern]] in any [[Media (communication)|medium]] can be said to convey some amount of information.  Whereas [[digital signals]] and other [[data]] use discrete [[Sign (semiotics)|signs]] to convey information, other phenomena and artifacts such as [[analog signals|analogue signals]], [[poems]], [[picture]]s, [[music]] or other [[sound]]s, and [[current (fluid)|currents]] convey information in a more continuous form.&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;{{cite book|title=Understanding Information Transmission|author1=John B. Anderson|author2=Rolf Johnnesson|publisher=Ieee Press|year=1996|isbn=978-0471711209}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Information is not [[knowledge]] itself, but the [[meaning (philosophy)|meaning]] that may be derived from a [[representation (mathematics)|representation]] through interpretation.&lt;ref name="Yockey"&gt;{{cite book|title=Information Theory, Evolution, and the Origin of Life|author=Hubert P. Yockey|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2005|page=7|isbn=978-0511546433}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of ''information'' is relevant or connected to various concepts,&lt;ref name="Floridi"&gt;{{cite book|author=Luciano Floridi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ak__GBAcHU0C|title=Information – A Very Short Introduction|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-19-160954-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Constraint (information theory)|constraint]], [[communication]], [[control system|control]], [[data]], [[shape|form]], [[education]], [[knowledge]], [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]], [[understanding]], [[stimulation|mental stimuli]], [[pattern theory|pattern]], [[perception]], [[Proposition#Treatment in logic|proposition]], [[knowledge representation|representation]], and [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]].

Information is often processed iteratively: Data available at one step are [[data processing|processed]] into information to be interpreted and processed at the next step.  For example, in [[written text]] each [[symbol]] or [[letter (alphabet)|letter]] conveys information relevant to the word it is part of, each word conveys information relevant to the phrase it is part of, each phrase conveys information relevant to the sentence it is part of, and so on until at the final step information is interpreted and becomes knowledge in a given [[knowledge domain|domain]].  In a [[digital signal]], [[bit]]s may be interpreted into the symbols, letters, numbers, or structures that convey the information available at the next level up.  The key characteristic of information is that it is subject to interpretation and processing.

The derivation of information from a signal or message may be thought of as the resolution of [[ambiguity]] or [[uncertainty]] that arises during the interpretation of patterns within the signal or message.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Webler |first1=Forrest |title=Measurement in the Age of Information |journal=Information |date=25 February 2022 |volume=13 |issue=3 |page=111 |doi=10.3390/info13030111 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Information may be structured as [[data]]. Redundant data can be [[data compression|compressed]] up to an optimal size, which is the theoretical limit of compression.

The information available through a collection of data may be derived by analysis.  For example, a restaurant collects data from every customer order. That information may be analyzed to produce knowledge that is put to use when the business subsequently wants to identify the most popular or least popular dish.{{Citation needed|date=May 2024}}

Information can be transmitted in time, via [[data storage]], and space, via [[communication]] and [[telecommunication]].&lt;ref name="Hilbertvideo2011"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIKPjOuwqHo  |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/iIKPjOuwqHo |archive-date=2021-12-21 |url-status=live|title=World_info_capacity_animation |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=11 June 2011 |access-date=1 May 2017}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt; Information is expressed either as the content of a [[message]] or through direct or indirect [[observation]]. That which is [[perceived]] can be construed as a message in its own right, and in that sense, all information is always conveyed as the content of a message.

Information can be [[encoded]] into various forms for [[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] and [[Language interpretation|interpretation]] (for example, information may be encoded into a [[sequence]] of [[sign (semiotics)|signs]], or transmitted via a [[signal]]). It can also be [[encrypted]] for safe storage and communication.

The uncertainty of an event is measured by its probability of occurrence. Uncertainty is proportional to the negative logarithm of the probability of occurrence. [[Information theory]] takes advantage of this by concluding that more uncertain events require more information to resolve their uncertainty. The [[bit]] is a typical [[unit of information]]. It is 'that which reduces uncertainty by half'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=DT&amp;SC 4-5: Information Theory Primer, Online Course |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qanHTredVE&amp;list=PLtjBSCvWCU3rNm46D3R85efM0hrzjuAIg&amp;index=42 |website=YouTube|publisher=University of California |publication-date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other units such as the [[Nat (unit)|nat]] may be used. For example, the information encoded in one "fair" coin flip is log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(2/1) = 1 bit, and in two fair coin flips is log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(4/1) = 2 bits. A 2011 ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' article estimates that 97% of technologically stored information was already in digital [[bit]]s in 2007 and that the year 2002 was the beginning of the [[digital age]] for information storage (with digital storage capacity bypassing analogue for the first time).&lt;ref name="HilbertLopez2011"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The World's Technological Capacity to Store, Communicate, and Compute Information|first1=Martin|last1=Hilbert|first2=Priscila|last2=López|date=2011|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume=332|issue=6025|pages=60–65|doi=10.1126/science.1200970|pmid = 21310967|bibcode=2011Sci...332...60H|s2cid=206531385|doi-access=free}} Free access to the article at martinhilbert.net/WorldInfoCapacity.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
{{See also|Information history#History of the word and concept "information"|l1=History of the word and concept "information"}}
The English word "information" comes from Middle French ''enformacion/informacion/information'' 'a criminal investigation' and its etymon, Latin ''informatiō(n)'' 'conception, teaching, creation'.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', Third Edition, 2009, [https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/95568 full text]&lt;/ref&gt;

In English, "information" is an uncountable [[mass noun]].

==Information theory==
{{main|Information theory}}
Information theory is the scientific study of the [[quantification (science)|quantification]], [[computer data storage|storage]], and [[telecommunication|communication]] of information. The field itself was fundamentally established by the work of [[Claude Shannon]] in the 1940s, with earlier contributions by [[Harry Nyquist]] and [[Ralph Hartley]] in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Pérez-Montoro Gutiérrez |first1=Mario |title=The Phenomenon of Information: A Conceptual Approach to Information Flow |last2=Edelstein |first2=Dick |date=2007 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=978-0-8108-5942-5 |location=Lanham (Md.) |pages=21–22 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Wesołowski |first=Krzysztof |url=http://ndl.ethernet.edu.et/bitstream/123456789/54386/1/33pdf.pdf |title=Introduction to Digital Communication Systems |date=2009 |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-0-470-98629-5 |edition=1. publ |location=Chichester |pages=2 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field is at the intersection of [[probability theory]], [[statistics]], computer science, [[statistical mechanics]], [[information engineering]], and [[electrical engineering]].

A key measure in information theory is [[information entropy|entropy]]. Entropy quantifies the amount of uncertainty involved in the value of a [[random variable]] or the outcome of a [[random process]]. For example, identifying the outcome of a fair [[coin flip]] (with two equally likely outcomes) provides less information (lower entropy) than specifying the outcome from a roll of a [[dice|die]] (with six equally likely outcomes). Some other important measures in information theory are [[mutual information]], channel capacity, [[error exponent]]s, and [[relative entropy]]. Important sub-fields of information theory include [[source coding]], [[algorithmic complexity theory]], [[algorithmic information theory]], and [[information-theoretic security]].

There is another opinion regarding the universal definition of information. It lies in the fact that the concept itself has changed along with the change of various historical epochs, and to find such a definition, it is necessary to find standard features and patterns of this transformation. For example, researchers in the field of information Petrichenko E. A. and Semenova V. G., based on a retrospective analysis of changes in the concept of information, give the following universal definition: "Information is a form of transmission of human experience (knowledge)." In their opinion, the change in the essence of the concept of information occurs after various breakthrough technologies for the transfer of experience (knowledge), i.e. the appearance of writing, the printing press, the first encyclopedias, the telegraph, the development of cybernetics, the creation of a microprocessor, the Internet, smartphones, etc. Each new form of experience transfer is a synthesis of the previous ones. That is why we see such a variety of definitions of information, because, according to the law of dialectics "negation-negation", all previous ideas about information are contained in a "filmed" form and in its modern representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Semenova |first1=Veronika |last2=Petrichenko |first2=Evgeny |title=Information: The History of Notion, Its Present and Future |date=2022 |url=https://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/informatsiya-istoriya-ponyatiya-ego-nastoyaschee-i-buduschee |journal=Izvestiya University.

Applications of fundamental topics of information theory include source coding/[[data compression]] (e.g. for [[ZIP files]]), and channel coding/[[error detection and correction]] (e.g. for [[DSL]]). Its impact has been crucial to the success of the [[Voyager program|Voyager]] missions to deep space, the invention of the [[compact disc]], the feasibility of mobile phones and the development of the Internet. The theory has also found applications in other areas, including [[statistical inference]],&lt;ref&gt;Burnham, K. P. and Anderson D. R.

&lt;/ref&gt; and even art creation.

== As sensory input ==
Often information can be viewed as a type of input to an [[organism]] or [[system]]. Inputs are of two kinds. Some inputs are important to the function of the organism (for example, food) or system ([[energy]]) by themselves. In his book ''Sensory Ecology''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dusenbery|first=David B.|date=1992|title=Sensory Ecology|url=https://archive.org/details/sensoryecologyho0000duse|url-access=registration|publisher=W.H. Freeman|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7167-2333-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; biophysicist [[David B. Dusenbery]] called these causal inputs. Other inputs (information) are important only because they are associated with causal inputs and can be used to [[predict]] the occurrence of a causal input at a later time (and perhaps another place). Some information is important because of association with other information but eventually there must be a connection to a causal input.

In practice, information is usually carried by weak stimuli that must be detected by specialized sensory systems and amplified by energy inputs before they can be functional to the organism or system. For example, light is mainly (but not only, e.g. plants can grow in the direction of the light source) a causal input to plants but for animals it only provides information. The colored light reflected from a flower is too weak for photosynthesis but the visual system of the bee detects it and the bee's nervous system uses the information to guide the bee to the flower, where the bee often finds nectar or pollen, which are causal inputs, a nutritional function.

== As representation and complexity ==
The [[cognitive scientist]] and applied mathematician Ronaldo Vigo argues that information is a concept that requires at least two related entities to make quantitative sense. These are, any dimensionally defined category of objects S, and any of its subsets R. R, in essence, is a representation of S, or, in other words, conveys representational (and hence, conceptual) information about S. Vigo then defines the amount of information that R conveys about S as the rate of change in the [[complexity]] of S whenever the objects in R are removed from S. Under "Vigo information", pattern, invariance, complexity, representation, and information{{snd}}five fundamental constructs of universal science{{snd}}are unified under a novel mathematical framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vigo|first=R. |title=Representational information: a new general notion and measure of information |journal=Information Sciences |volume=181 |issue=21 |pages=4847–4859 |year=2011 |doi=10.1016/j.ins.2011.05.020|url=http://cogprints.org/7961/1/Vigo_Information_Sciences.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vigo | first1 = R. | year = 2013 | title = Complexity over Uncertainty in Generalized Representational Information Theory (GRIT): A Structure-Sensitive General Theory of Information | journal = Information | volume = 4 | issue = 1| pages = 1–30 | doi = 10.3390/info4010001 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vigo|first=R.|date=2014|title=Mathematical Principles of Human Conceptual Behavior: The Structural Nature of Conceptual Representation and Processing|publisher=Scientific Psychology Series, Routledge|location=New York and London|isbn=978-0415714365}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things, the framework aims to overcome the limitations of [[Shannon–Hartley theorem|Shannon-Weaver information]] when attempting to characterize and measure subjective information.

== As an influence that leads to transformation ==
Information is any type of pattern that influences the formation or transformation of other patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shannon|first=Claude E.|author-link=Claude E. Shannon|title=The Mathematical Theory of Communication|year=1949|title-link=A Mathematical Theory of Communication|bibcode=1949mtc..book.....S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Casagrande|first=David|title=Information as verb: Re-conceptualizing information for cognitive and ecological models|journal=Journal of Ecological Anthropology|year=1999|volume=3|issue=1|pages=4–13|url=http://www.lehigh.edu/~dac511/literature/casagrande1999.pdf|doi=10.5038/2162-4593.3.1.1|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, there is no need for a conscious mind to perceive, much less appreciate, the pattern. Consider, for example, [[DNA]]. The sequence of [[nucleotide]]s is a pattern that influences the formation and development of an [[organism]] without any need for a conscious mind. One might argue though that for a human to consciously define a pattern, for example a nucleotide, naturally involves conscious information processing. However, the existence of [[unicellular]] and [[multicellular]] organisms, with the complex [[biochemistry]] that leads, among other events, to the existence of [[enzymes]] and polynucleotides that interact maintaining the biological order and participating in the development of multicellular organisms, precedes by millions of years the emergence of human consciousness and the creation of the scientific culture that produced the chemical nomenclature.

[[Systems theory]] at times seems to refer to information in this sense, assuming information does not necessarily involve any conscious mind, and patterns circulating (due to [[feedback]]) in the system can be called information. In other words, it can be said that information in this sense is something potentially perceived as representation, though not created or presented for that purpose. For example, [[Gregory Bateson]] defines "information" as a "difference that makes a difference".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bateson|first=Gregory|title= Form, Substance, and Difference, in Steps to an Ecology of Mind|year=1972|publisher=University of Chicago Press|pages=448–466}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If, however, the premise of "influence" implies that information has been perceived by a conscious mind and also interpreted by it, the specific [[Context (linguistics)|context]] associated with this interpretation may cause the transformation of the information into [[knowledge]]. Complex definitions of both "information" and "knowledge" make such semantic and logical analysis difficult, but the condition of "transformation" is an important point in the study of information as it relates to knowledge, especially in the business discipline of [[knowledge management]]. In this practice, tools and processes are used to assist a [[knowledge worker]] in performing research and making decisions, including steps such as:
* Review information to effectively derive value and meaning
* Reference [[metadata]] if available
* Establish [[Relevance|relevant]] context, often from many possible contexts
* Derive new knowledge from the information
* Make decisions or recommendations from the resulting knowledge

Stewart (2001) argues that transformation of information into knowledge is critical, lying at the core of value creation and [[competitive advantage]] for the modern enterprise.

In a biological framework, Mizraji &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mizraji|first=E.|title=The biological Maxwell's demons: exploring ideas about the information processing in biological systems |journal=Theory in Biosciences.|volume=140 |pages=307–318 |year=2021 |issue=3 |doi= 10.1007/s12064-021-00354-6|pmid=34449033 |pmc=8568868 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has described information as an entity emerging from the interaction of patterns with receptor systems (eg: in molecular or neural receptors capable of interacting with specific patterns, information emerges from those interactions). In addition, he has incorporated the idea of "information catalysts", structures where emerging information promotes the transition from pattern recognition to goal-directed action (for example, the specific transformation of a substrate into a product by an enzyme, or auditory reception of words and the production of an oral response)

The Danish Dictionary of Information Terms&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Bo Krantz|last=Simonsen |url=http://www.informationsordbogen.dk/concept.php?cid=902 |title=Informationsordbogen – vis begreb |website=Informationsordbogen.dk |access-date=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that information only provides an answer to a posed question. Whether the answer provides knowledge depends on the informed person. So a generalized definition of the concept should be: "Information" = An answer to a specific question".

When [[Marshall McLuhan]] speaks of [[media (communication)|media]] and their effects on human cultures, he refers to the structure of [[cultural artifact|artifacts]] that in turn shape our behaviors and mindsets. Also, [[pheromone]]s are often said to be "information" in this sense.

== Technologically mediated information ==
{{Further|Information Age}}
These sections are using measurements of data rather than information, as information cannot be directly measured.

=== As of 2007 ===
It is estimated that the world's technological capacity to store information grew from 2.6 (optimally compressed) [[exabytes]] in 1986 – which is the informational equivalent to less than one 730-MB [[CD-ROM]] per person (539 MB per person) – to 295 (optimally compressed) [[exabytes]] in 2007.&lt;ref name="HilbertLopez2011"/&gt; This is the informational equivalent of almost 61 [[CD-ROM]] per person in 2007.&lt;ref name="Hilbertvideo2011"/&gt;

The world's combined technological capacity to receive information through one-way [[broadcast]] networks was the informational equivalent of 174 [[newspaper]]s per person per day in 2007.&lt;ref name="HilbertLopez2011"/&gt;

The world's combined effective capacity to exchange information through two-way [[telecommunication]] networks was the informational equivalent of 6 newspapers per person per day in 2007.&lt;ref name="Hilbertvideo2011"/&gt;

As of 2007, an estimated 90% of all new information is digital, mostly stored on hard drives.&lt;ref&gt;Failure Trends in a Large Disk Drive Population. Eduardo Pinheiro, Wolf-Dietrich Weber and Luiz Andre Barroso&lt;/ref&gt;

=== As of 2020 ===
The total amount of data created, captured, copied, and consumed globally is forecast to increase rapidly, reaching 64.2 zettabytes in 2020. Over the next five years up to 2025, global data creation is projected to grow to more than 180 zettabytes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Total data volume worldwide 2010–2025|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/871513/worldwide-data-created/|access-date=2021-08-06|website=Statista|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== As records ==
{{LibraryandInformation-TopicSidebar}}
Records are specialized forms of information. Essentially, records are information produced consciously or as by-products of business activities or transactions and retained because of their value. Primarily, their value is as evidence of the activities of the organization but they may also be retained for their informational value. Sound [[records management]] ensures that the integrity of records is preserved for as long as they are required.{{Citation needed|date=May 2024}}

The international standard on records management, ISO 15489, defines records as "information created, received, and maintained as evidence and information by an organization or person, in pursuance of legal obligations or in the transaction of business".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=ISO 15489}}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Committee on Archives (ICA) Committee on electronic records defined a record as, "recorded information produced or received in the initiation, conduct or completion of an institutional or individual activity and that comprises content, context and structure sufficient to provide evidence of the activity".&lt;ref name="ica"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Committee on Electronic Records |title= Guide For Managing Electronic Records From An Archival Perspective |url=https://www.ica.org/sites/default/files/ICA%20Study%208%20guide_eng.pdf |website=www.ica.org |publisher=International Committee on Archives |access-date=9 February 2019 |page=22 |date=February 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Records may be maintained to retain [[corporate memory]] of the organization or to meet legal, fiscal or accountability requirements imposed on the organization. Willis expressed the view that sound management of business records and information delivered "...six key requirements for good [[corporate governance]]...transparency; accountability; due process; compliance; meeting statutory and common law requirements; and security of personal and corporate information."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Willis |first1=Anthony |title=Corporate governance and management of information and records |journal=Records Management Journal |date=1 August 2005 |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=86–97 |doi=10.1108/09565690510614238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Semiotics ==
[[Michael Buckland]] has classified "information" in terms of its uses: "information as process", "information as knowledge", and "information as thing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buckland|first1=Michael K.|author-link=Michael Buckland|title=Information as thing|journal=[[Journal of the American Society for Information Science]]|date=June 1991|volume=42|issue=5|pages=351–360|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199106)42:5&lt;351::AID-ASI5&gt;3.0.CO;2-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Beynon-Davies|Beynon-Davies]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beynon-Davies|first=P.|date=2002|title=Information Systems: an introduction to informatics in Organisations|publisher=Palgrave|location=Basingstoke, UK|isbn=978-0-333-96390-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beynon-Davies|first=P.|date=2009|title=Business Information Systems|publisher=Palgrave|location=Basingstoke|isbn=978-0-230-20368-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; explains the multi-faceted concept of information in terms of signs and signal-sign systems. Signs themselves can be considered in terms of four inter-dependent levels, layers or branches of [[semiotics]]: pragmatics, semantics, syntax, and empirics. These four layers serve to connect the social world on the one hand with the physical or technical world on the other.

[[Pragmatics]] is concerned with the purpose of communication. Pragmatics links the issue of signs with the context within which signs are used. The focus of pragmatics is on the intentions of living agents underlying communicative behaviour. In other words, pragmatics link language to action.

[[Semantics]] is concerned with the meaning of a message conveyed in a communicative act. Semantics considers the content of communication. Semantics is the study of the meaning of signs – the association between signs and behaviour. Semantics can be considered as the study of the link between symbols and their referents or concepts – particularly the way that signs relate to human behavior.

[[Syntax]] is concerned with the formalism used to represent a message. Syntax as an area studies the form of communication in terms of the logic and grammar of sign systems. Syntax is devoted to the study of the form rather than the content of signs and sign systems.

Nielsen (2008) discusses the relationship between semiotics and information in relation to dictionaries. He introduces the concept of [[lexicographic information cost]]s and refers to the effort a user of a dictionary must make to first find, and then understand data so that they can generate information.

Communication normally exists within the context of some social situation. The social situation sets the context for the intentions conveyed (pragmatics) and the form of communication. In a communicative situation intentions are expressed through messages that comprise collections of inter-related signs taken from a language mutually understood by the agents involved in the communication. Mutual understanding implies that agents involved understand the chosen language in terms of its agreed syntax and semantics. The sender codes the message in the language and sends the message as signals along some communication channel (empirics). The chosen communication channel has inherent properties that determine outcomes such as the speed at which communication can take place, and over what distance.

== Physics and determinacy ==

The existence of information about a [[closed system]] is a major concept in both [[classical physics]] and [[quantum mechanics]], encompassing the ability, real or theoretical, of an agent to predict the future state of a system based on knowledge gathered during its past and present. [[Determinism]] is a philosophical theory holding that causal determination can predict all future events,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ernest Nagel |title=The Structure of Science: Problems in the Logic of Scientific Explanation |publisher=Hackett |year=1999 |isbn=978-0915144716 |edition=2nd |pages=285–292 |chapter=§V: Alternative descriptions of physical state |quote=A theory is deterministic if, and only if, given its state variables for some initial period, the theory logically determines a unique set of values for those variables for any other period. |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u6EycHgRfkQC&amp;pg=PA285}}&lt;/ref&gt; positing a fully predictable [[universe]] described by classical physicist [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] as "[[Laplace's demon|the effect of its past and the cause of its future]]".&lt;ref name="Truscott"&gt;Laplace, Pierre Simon, ''[[A Philosophical Essay on Probabilities]]'', translated into English from the original French 6th ed. by Truscott, F.W. and Emory, F.L., Dover Publications (New York, 1951) p.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Quantum physics instead encodes information as a [[wave function]], which prevents observers from directly identifying all of its possible [[measurement (quantum physics)|measurement]]s. Prior to the publication of [[Bell's theorem]], determinists reconciled with this behavior using [[hidden variable theories]], which argued that the information necessary to predict the future of a function ''must'' exist, even if it is not accessible for humans; A view surmised by [[Albert Einstein]] with the assertion that "[[God does not play dice]]".&lt;ref name="Einstein letter, 4 Dec 1926"&gt;[https://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol15-trans/437 The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, Volume 15: The Berlin Years: Writings &amp; Correspondence, June 1925-May 1927 (English Translation Supplement), p. 403]&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern [[astronomy]] cites the mechanical sense of information in the [[black hole information paradox]], positing that, because the complete evaporation of a [[black hole]] into [[Hawking radiation]] leaves nothing except an expanding cloud of [[homogeneous]] particles, this results in the irrecoverability of any information about the matter to have originally crossed the [[event horizon]], violating both classical and quantum assertions against the ability to destroy information.&lt;ref name="SH-2006"&gt;{{cite video |people=Hawking, Stephen |title=The Hawking Paradox |url=http://dsc.discovery.com/tv-shows/other-shows/videos/other-shows-into-the-universe-with-stephen-hawking.htm |date=2006 |publisher=[[Discovery Channel]] |access-date=13 August 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130802071021/http://dsc.discovery.com/tv-shows/other-shows/videos/other-shows-into-the-universe-with-stephen-hawking.htm |archive-date=2 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20130812"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |author-link=Dennis Overbye |title=A Black Hole Mystery Wrapped in a Firewall Paradox |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/13/science/space/a-black-hole-mystery-wrapped-in-a-firewall-paradox.html |date=12 August 2013 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=12 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The application of information study ==
The information cycle (addressed as a whole or in its distinct components) is of great concern to [[information technology]], [[information systems]], as well as [[information science]]. These fields deal with those processes and techniques pertaining to information capture (through [[sensors]]) and generation (through [[computation]], [[formulation]] or composition), [[Data processing|processing]] (including encoding, encryption, compression, packaging), [[Data transmission|transmission]] (including all [[telecommunication]] methods), presentation (including [[Information visualization|visualization]] / [[display device|display]] methods), [[Digital Storage|storage]] (such as magnetic or optical, including [[Holographic data storage|holographic methods]]), etc.

[[Information visualization]] (shortened as InfoVis) depends on the computation and digital representation of data, and assists users in [[pattern recognition]] and [[anomaly detection]].
&lt;gallery&gt;

Structure of the Universe.jpg|Galactic (including dark) matter distribution in a cubic section of the Universe
Attractor Poisson Saturne.jpg|Visual representation of a strange attractor, with converted data of its fractal structure
&lt;/gallery&gt;

[[Information security]] (shortened as InfoSec) is the ongoing process of exercising due diligence to protect information, and information systems, from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, destruction, modification, disruption or distribution, through algorithms and procedures focused on monitoring and detection, as well as incident response and repair.

[[Information analysis]] is the process of inspecting, transforming, and modeling information, by converting raw data into actionable knowledge, in support of the decision-making process.

[[Information Quality (InfoQ)|Information quality]] (shortened as InfoQ) is the potential of a dataset to achieve a specific (scientific or practical) goal using a given empirical analysis method.

[[Infocommunications|Information communication]] represents the convergence of informatics, telecommunication and audio-visual media &amp; content.

'''Tele-information services''' are based on an alliance of digital [[telecommunication]] and [[computer technology]] that play an important role in inter-[[human communication]]s. It is a classification of [[information flow]]s broken down so that the presentation and information content are not confused with the character of the information flow. Tele-information services consist of four definable information traffic patterns being ''allocution'', ''conversation'', ''consultation'' and ''registration''. These [[Tele-information services#Information traffic patterns|information traffic patterns]] can be combined to form more complex multi-pattern services and networks made up of any number of information traffic patterns.&lt;ref name="bordwijk"&gt;Bordewijk, Jan L. and Van Kaam, Ben (2002) [1986] "Towards a New Classification of Tele-Information Services," in Denis McQuail (ed.) ''McQuail's Reader in Mass Communication Theory,'' Sage, London, pp. 113–124.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information traffic patterns==

* Allocution — the issue of information by an information service centre under programmatic control of the centre itself. Typically has a general/soldier, master/slave relationship. Examples include [[broadcasting]] organisations such as [[radio]] and [[television]].
* Conversation — the issue of information by information services consumer(s) under programmatic control of the consumer(s) themselves. Examples include information flow between consumers or with the help of an interpreter.
* Consultation — the issue of information by an information service provider under programmatic control of an information service consumer. Examples include phoning a doctor, lawyer, reading books, magazines and newspapers as well as cable television and the Internet.
* Registration — the issue of information by an information service consumer under the programmatic control of an information service centre. Examples include a fire alarm, news agencies and some [[MMORPG|MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game)]] such as [[World of Warcraft]].&lt;ref name="bordwijk" /&gt;

'''Global information system''' is an information system which is developed and / or used in a global context. Some examples of GIS are SAP,  The Global Learning Objects Brokered Exchange and other systems.
== Definition ==
There are a variety of definitions and understandings of a global information system (GIS, GLIS), such as

* A '''global information system (GIS)''' is an information system which is developed and / or used in a global context.&lt;ref&gt;Pawlowski, J.M.: Globale Informationssysteme (Global Information Systems). In: Kurbel, K., Becker, J., Gronau, N., Sinz, E., [[Leena Suhl|Suhl, L.]] (Eds.): Online Lexikon Wirtschaftsinformatik [http://www.enzyklopaedie-der-wirtschaftsinformatik.de/wi-enzyklopaedie/lexikon/uebergreifendes/Globalisierung/Globales-Informationssystem ''Online Encyclopedia Business Information Systems''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100118043033/http://www.enzyklopaedie-der-wirtschaftsinformatik.de/wi-enzyklopaedie/lexikon/uebergreifendes/Globalisierung/Globales-Informationssystem |date=2010-01-18 }}, Oldenbourg, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A '''global information system''' (GIS) is any [[information system]] which attempts to deliver the totality of measurable data worldwide within a defined context.

Common to this class of [[information systems]] is that the context is a global setting, either for its use or development process. This means that it highly relates to [[distributed systems]] / [[distributed computing]] where the distribution is global. The term also incorporates aspects of global software development and there [[outsourcing]] (when the outsourcing locations are globally distributed) and [[offshoring]] aspects. A specific aspect of global information systems is the case (domain) of [[global software development]].&lt;ref&gt;Sangwan, R., Bass, M., Mullick, N., Paulish, D.J., Kazmeier, J. (2006): Global Software Development Handbook, Auerback Publications, 2006. {{ISBN|0-8493-9384-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A main research aspect in this field concerns the coordination of and collaboration between virtual teams.&lt;ref&gt;Carmel, E.

== Tasks in designing global information systems ==
Critical tasks in designing global information systems are 
* Process and system design: How are the processes between distributed actors organized, how are the systems distributed / integrated.
* Technical architecture: What is the technical infrastructure enabling actors to collaborate?
* Support mechanisms: How are actors in the process of communication, collaboration, and cooperation supported?

A variety of examples can be given. Basically every multi-lingual website can be seen as a global information system. However, mostly the term GLIS is used to refer to a specific system developed or used in a global context.

== Examples ==
Specific examples are 
* Systems developed for multinational users, e.g., [http://www.sap.com SAP as a global ERP system]
* Global Information Systems for Education: [https://web.archive.org/web/20190526175851/http://www.globe-info.org/ The Global Learning Objects Brokered Exchange]
* For the specific case of data integration : http://data.un.org, https://web.archive.org/web/20190825060649/http://www.internettrafficreport.com/, http://www.unhcr.org/statistics.html

'''Information space''' is the set of concepts, and relations among them, held by an [[information system]];&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Newby, ''[http://www.petascale.org/papers/newby-trec5.pdf Metric Multidimensional Information Space] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809064915/https://www.petascale.org/papers/newby-trec5.pdf |date=2017-08-09 }}'', ''[[Text Retrieval Conference]]'', 4 November 1996&lt;/ref&gt; it describes the range of possible values or meanings an entity can have under the given rules and circumstances.

==Scholarly definitions==

{{Quotation|An information space is a type of information design in which representations of information objects are situated in a principled space.

Another definition, which is a bit more idealistic, is that an Information Space is the total result of the [[semantic]] activity of the humanity, "the world of names and titles", conjugated to the [[ontological]] world. Being a primary concept, the information space cannot be precisely defined and is set as a [[dialectical]] opposition to the material, physical, object space.&lt;ref&gt;Sergei Pereslegin, Elena Pereslegina, [http://www.archipelag.ru/geoculture/geo/anthology/enough/ What is enough for Herodotus...] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809163649/http://www.archipelag.ru/geoculture/geo/anthology/enough/ |date=2014-08-09 }}, ''Russian archipelago'', 2001 {{in lang|ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Community indicators''' are "measurements that provide information about past and current trends and assist planners and community leaders in making decisions that affect future outcomes".{{citation needed|date=April 2025}} They provide insight into the overall direction of a community: whether it is improving, declining, or staying the same, or is some mix of all three.

In essence, indicators are measurements that reflect the interplay between social, environmental, and economic factors affecting a region’s or community’s [[Quality of life|well-being]]. Community indicators projects typically are conducted by [[non-profit organization]]s within a community, although in some cases they are initiated by the public sector.

== History ==
Community indicators are a localized response to the perceived invalidity of the traditional predominantly economic indicators, such as GDP, that are used for measuring human progress. This invalidity takes two forms. First, economic indicators account for all money transactions as beneficial for quality of life, whereas some of these can be seen as decidedly negative (e.g., money spent on environmental cleanup of pollution that could have been prevented). Secondly, strictly economic indicators do not count the value of non-monetary activity, such as homemaker and volunteer work and non-cash public assistance, which are decidedly positive for the quality of life of many families (Journal article by David Swain, Danielle Hollar; International Journal of Public Administration, Vol. 26, 2003).{{citation needed|date=February 2022}}

A communities level approach to this apparent invalidity is based on the evidence of a social group whose members reside in a specific locality, share government, and often have a common culture and history. Community indicators are not a new concept; they have been in use since 1910, when the [[Russell Sage Foundation]] initiated the development of local surveys for measuring industrial, educational, recreational, and other factors. The processes used by the Sage Foundation are similar to those that reemerged during the 1990s. But the difference today is the use of indicators to consider the full spectrum of a community’s well-being, not just isolated factors. Nowadays, indicators are used by many constituencies within a [[community]]. After a decade of renewed attention to community indicators, they now represent a valuable mechanism to improve monitoring and evaluation in planning.

Russell Sage Foundation employed “over two thousand local surveys taken on education, recreation, [[public health]], crime, and general social conditions” to assess social conditions. The first survey was conducted in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]. (In the late 1990s, Pittsburgh again embraced indicators, with its Sustainable Pittsburgh Goals and Indicators Project.) Many of the surveys used by the Sage Foundation were conducted by nonprofit organizations, such as [[Chamber of commerce|chambers of commerce]] and citizen committees. These surveys yielded social trends indicators and were popular until the [[Great Depression]] and World War II, when economic measures such as the [[gross domestic product]] or [[Measures of national income and output|gross national product]] indicators took greater precedence

== Community information systems objectives ==
'''Community information systems''' ('''CIS''') bring together a wide range of community indicators — [[social]], [[economic]] and [[Natural environment|environmental]] data and information around objectives:

* Monitoring the health, social well-being and sustainability of communities through the management of Quality of Life indicators;
* Bringing together government performance indicators and community targeted indicators into a single solution;
* Widening the use of data by citizens and public officials to support decision-making, improve policy and target resources;
* Providing a wider local intelligence context to [[key performance indicators]] for government officials;
* Communicating outcome measures to citizens, stimulating public debate and building confidence in progress towards societal goals.

'''Information policy''' is the set of all public laws, regulations, and policies that encourage, discourage, or regulate the creation, use, storage, access, and communication and dissemination of [[information]].{{sfn|McClure|1989|p={{page needed|date=May 2025}}}} The concept encompasses any other decision-making practice with society-wide constitutive efforts that involve the flow of information and how it is processed.{{sfn|Braman|2011|pp=3-4}}

Several fundamental issues that comprise information policy.{{sfn|Braman|2011|p=1}} Most prominent are [[public policy]] issues concerned with the use of information for democratization and commercialization of social life. These issues include the [[digital divide]], [[intellectual property]], economic regulations, [[freedom of expression]], [[confidentiality]] or privacy of information, [[information security]], access management, and regulating the dissemination of public information.{{cn|date=May 2025}} The most common audience for information policy analysis includes undergraduate and graduate students, scholars, policymakers, policy analysts, as well as those members of the public who have taken an interest in understanding the effects of the laws and regulations involving information.{{sfn|Braman|2011|p=1}}

== Overview ==
Information policy is the central problem for information societies. As nations make the transition from industrialism to post-industrialism, information issues become increasingly critical. According to sociologist [[Daniel Bell]], "what counts now is not raw muscle power or energy but information."{{sfn|Bell|1973|p=127}} While all societies have been to some extent based on information, information societies are almost wholly dependent on computerized information. Marc Uri Porat, the first researcher to use the term "information policy,"{{sfn|Duff|2004|p=73}} wrote: "The foundation of the information economy, our new central fact, is the computer. Its ability to manipulate and process information represents a profound departure from our modest human abilities." The computer's combination with telecommunications, he continued, posed "the policy problems of the future."{{sfn|Porat|1977|p=205}}

Information policy became a prominent field of study during the latter half of the 20th century.{{sfn|Braman|2011|p=1}} It has since  evolved from being seen as relatively unimportant to having a much more overarching significance since it establishes the conditions “under which all other decision making, public discourse, and political activity occur.”{{sfn|Braman|2011|p=2}} The growing awareness in the importance of information policy has sparked an interest in various groups to further study and analyze its magnitude.

Although information policy generally has a broader definition and encapsulates a multitude of components, its scope and impact can vary depending on the context. For example, in the context of an information lifecycle, information policy refers to the laws and policies that deal with the stages information goes through beginning with its creation, through its collection, organization, dissemination, and finally to its destruction.{{sfn|Mason|1983|p={{page needed|date=May 2025}}}} On the other hand, in the context of public administration, information policy is the means by which government employees, institutions, and information systems adapt themselves to an environment in rapid fluctuation and use information for decision-making.{{sfn|Andersen|Dawes|1991|p=13}}{{sfn|Bozeman|Bretschneider|1986|page=479-480}}{{sfn|Stevens|MacGowan|1985|pp=49, 213}}

Information policy is a combination of several varying disciplines including [[information sciences|information science]], [[economics]], [[law]], and [[public policy]].{{sfn|Braman|2011|p=1}} Thus, its scope may differ when each of these disciplines analyses or uses it. The information sciences may be more concerned with technical advances and how this impacts information policy, while from a law perspective, issues such as privacy rights and intellectual property may be of greatest focus.{{sfn|Hill|1995|p=275}}

== History==
The earliest sight of information policy was present around the mid-1900s. The stages to begin evolving from an industrial society to an information society sparked several other transformations. The common industrial technologies were beginning to be replaced by informational meta-technologies. Organizations began changing their form, several new architectures of knowledge developed, and most importantly, the information economy replaced industrial and agricultural economies.{{sfn|Braman|2006|p=1}}

By the 1970s, the concept of national information policy was created to protect the data and information that was used in creating public policies. The earliest adopters of information policy included the United States,{{sfn|Heim|1986|pp=21-22, 26, 29}} Australia, as well as several European countries who all recognized the importance for a more standardized governance of information.

Elizabeth Orna contributed to a paper on information policies by providing a brief history of the development of ideas surrounding national and organizational information policies, from the beginning when the [[United Kingdom]] Ministry of Information was established in the [[World War I|First World War]] to present day.{{sfn|Orna|2008|p=548}}

In the 20th century, to cope with the privacy problems of databases, information policy evolved further safeguards. In the US, the federal [[Privacy Act of 1974|Privacy Act]] provides individuals the right to inspect and correct personal information in federal data files.

== Types and importance ==
The types of information policy can be separated into two different categories. It can be discussed in the short-term focus exclusively on information science. It can also have a much broader context in relation to different subjects and be within a larger time period, for example dating back to Roman civilization, the Bill of Rights, or the Constitution.{{sfn|Braman|2011|pp=1-2}}

The obvious reason for the need of information policy deals with the legal issues that can be associated with the advancement of technology. More precisely,—the digitization of the cultural content made the cost of the copy decreasing to nearly zero and increased the illegal exchange of files, online, via sharing web site or [[Peer-to-peer file sharing|P2P]] technologies, or off line (copy of hard disks). As a result, there are many grey areas between what users can and cannot do, and this creates the need for some sort of regulation. Today, this has led to the creation of SOPA ([[Stop Online Piracy Act]]).{{cn|date=May 2025}} Information policy will mark the boundaries needed to evaluate certain issues dealing with the creation, processing, exchange, access, and use of information.{{sfn|Braman|2011|p=3}}

Boundaries are essential for avoiding risks, such as financial losses from incomplete and uncoordinated exploitation of information, wasted time, failures of innovation, and reputation loss; for positive benefits, including negotiation and openness among those responsible for different aspects of information management; productive use of IT in supporting staff in their use of information; and the ability to initiate change to take advantage of changing environments.

== Issues ==
There are some issues around organizational information policies, which are the interaction between human beings and technology for using information, the issue to proceed information policy itself, whether top-down or middle-up-down, is the best way to approach information policy in an organization. Also, issues that information tends to be influenced by organization's culture that result in complexity of information flow. Moreover, the concern about valuing information is discussed by Orna, the fact that value of information is dependent on the user, and it can't be measured by price.{{sfn|Orna|2008|p=551-552}} Considering that information is an asset or intellectual capital that becomes valuable when it is used in productive ways.

== Convergence==
Convergence essentially combines all forms of media, telecommunications, broadcasting, and computing by the use of a single technology: digital computers.{{sfn|Garcia-Murillo|MacInnes|2003|p=57}} It integrates diverse technological systems in the hopes of improving performance of similar tasks. Convergence is thought to be the result of the need for expansion into new markets due to competition and technological advances that have created a threat of new entrants into various segments of the value chain.{{sfn|Garcia-Murillo|MacInnes|2003|p=57-58}} As a result, previously disparate technologies interact with one other synergistically to deliver information in new and unique ways and allow for inventive solutions to be developed.

Nearly every innovative trend in the social industry involves adding data or layers of connectivity.{{sfn|Stanchak|2010|p={{page needed|date=May 2025}}}} Social networking sites have begun interacting with e-mail functionalities, search engines have begun integrating Internet searches with Facebook data, Twitter along with various other social media platforms have started to play a prominent role in the emergency management framework (mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery) among several others.

In 2012 a prominent issue arose that deals with the convergence of social media with copyright infringement monitoring systems. The growing interest in this topic can be largely attributed to the recent anti-piracy bills: the [[Stop Online Piracy Act]] and the [[PROTECT IP Act]].{{sfn|Reisinger|Jan 2012}} Various officials from all over the world have expressed an interest in forcing social networks to install and utilize monitoring systems to determine if users are illegally obtaining copyrighted material.{{sfn|Reisinger|March 2012|p={{page needed|date=May 2025}}}} For example, if implemented, these filters could prevent the illegal sharing of music over social networking platforms. The convergence of search engines and social networks could make this process even easier. Search engines such as Google, Yahoo, and Bing have begun to merge with social media platforms to link Internet searches to your social networking sites such as Facebook.{{sfn|Houck|2012|p={{page needed|date=May 2025}}}} This poses an even greater threat to users since their Internet searches can be monitored via their social networks.

The issue of converging social networks with piracy monitoring systems becomes controversial when it comes to protecting personal data and abiding by [[privacy law]]s. In order for a synergy such as this one to take place, regulatory convergence would need to be considered. Regulatory convergence is the merging of previously disparate industry-based laws and regulations into a single legal and regulatory framework.{{sfn|Garcia-Murillo|MacInnes|2003|p=57-58}}

== Internet governance ==
Internet governance has both narrow and broad definitions, thus, making it a complex concept to understand. When most people think of Internet governance, they think of the regulations of the content and conduct that are communicated and acted on through the Internet.{{sfn|Solum|2008|p=50}} Although this is certainly a broad component of Internet governance, additionally, there are more narrow elements to the definition that are often overlooked. Internet governance also encompasses the regulation of Internet infrastructure and the processes, systems, and institutions that regulate the fundamental systems that determine the capabilities of the Internet.{{sfn|Solum|2008|p=50}}

Architecture is the foundation of the Internet. The fundamental goal of the Internet architecture is to essentially create a network of networks by interconnecting various computer network systems globally.{{sfn|Solum|2008|p=50}} Protocols such as TCP/IP as well as other network protocols serve as the rules and conventions by which computers can communicate with each other.{{sfn|Solum|2008|p=50}} Thus, TCP/IP is often viewed as the most important institution of Internet governance.{{sfn|Solum|2008|p=50}} It serves as the backbone to network connectivity.

Organizations such as the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ([[ICANN]]) coordinate the various systems within the Internet on a global level to help preserve the operational stability of the Internet.{{sfn|Solum|2008|p=50}} For example, coordination of IP addresses and managing the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) ensure computers and devices can correctly connect to the Internet and can communicate effectively globally. If regulation of these crucial elements of the Internet such as TCP/IP and DNS were governed by disparate principles, the Internet would no longer exist as it does today. Networks, computers, and peripherals would not be able to communicate and have the same accessibility if these foundational elements varied.

== Government roles ==
Like with any policy, there needs to be an agent to govern and regulate it. With information policy in a broader sense, the government has several roles and responsibilities. Some examples include providing accurate information, producing and maintaining information that meets the specific needs of the public, protecting the privacy and confidentiality of personal and sensitive information, and making informed decisions on which information should be disseminated and how to distribute it effectively, among others.{{sfn|Browne|1997|p=263, 270-271}} Although the government plays an active role in information policy, the analysis of information policy should not only include the formal decision making processes by government entities, but also the formal and informal decisions of both the private and public sector of governance.{{sfn|Braman|2011|p=4}}

=== Security vs freedom of information ===
A persistent debate concerning the government role in information policy is the separation of security and freedom of information. Legislation such as the [[Patriot Act|Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism]] (USA PATRIOT or USAPA) Act of 2001 is an example of security taking precedence over civil liberties. The USAPA affected several surveillance and privacy laws to include: 
* Wire Tapping (Title III) which requires there be probable cause for real-time interception of voice and data communication.
* [[Electronic Communications Privacy Act]] (ECPA) regulates government access to email and other electronic communications.
* [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]] (FISA) authorizes the government to carry out electronic surveillance against any person, including Americans.
The USAPA was passed in October 2001, not long after [[September 11 attacks|9/11]] and without much contention from Congress. Civil liberties advocates argue that the changes made to the standing surveillance laws were done in an abrupt manner and without consideration to basic rights as outlined in the US constitution, specifically [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|fourth amendment]] rights which protects against unreasonable search and seizure.

== Research methods and tools ==
The five broad methodological strands identified by Rowlands{{sfn|Rowlands|1996|p={{page needed|date=May 2025}}}} are current tools for information policy study:
# &lt;u&gt;Classification&lt;/u&gt;: Thetool demonstrates a wide range of issues and subjects on information policy. It helps research to understand the breadth of the subject. The published materials are reasonably well documented and described. It is also good for start-up literature review and research purposes.
# &lt;u&gt;Identification of policy issues and options&lt;/u&gt;: This tool relies on inputs for information; for example, interviews and questionnaires targeting policy makers and other stakeholders. It is a commonly used in the studies of on-the-job policy makers in government or industry.
# &lt;u&gt;Reductionism&lt;/u&gt;: The reductionist approach control factors to reduce ambiguity. The factors include constraining data collection, analysis and interpretation within the framework of a specific discipline. It helps researchers to notice how a specific factor relates to the overall environment.
# &lt;u&gt;Forecasting and scenario-building&lt;/u&gt;: The commonly used model is [[PEST analysis|STEEP framework]]. It helps in reducing uncertainties for a topic that is under studies.
# &lt;u&gt;Process-oriented research and cases studies&lt;/u&gt;: It provides detailed contextual analyses of particular events. It helps researcher to experience the policy process in semi-real situation and study its outcome.

== The Future==
In regard to the future of information policy, it should be flexible and changing to different circumstances as the ability to access, store, and share information grows.{{sfn|Galvin|1994|p={{page needed|date=May 2025}}}} Galvin suggests that information policy might include setting a boundary to the uncertainty in this field.{{sfn|Galvin|1994|p={{page needed|date=May 2025}}}} As information policy becomes a larger and more important topic, it will also become a greater subject to governmental regulation in regards to the future of technology as well.{{sfn|Braman|2011|p=5}} It will also include the studies of these subjects: information science, communications, library science, and technology studies.{{sfn|Braman|2011|p=2}}

The information policies will earn more advantages for national and organizational, such as getting the best from development of [[Web 2.0]] nationally and in organization, influence people for paying attention to the socio aspect and socio-technical system, for securing preservation of digital content, bringing out information product, also respecting all users and making thinking time respectable.

In order to achieve this national organization, it will be important to focus not only on a domestic level but also nationally. Making domestic agencies cooperate internationally (and vice versa) though, will not be overly successful. A single nation can take the lead in establishing communication-based relationships specifically regarding the internet. These relations will need to be slowly and consistently established in order to truly unify any kind of information policy and decision-making. If information policy can be established and guided on a semi-national level, the degree of communication and cooperation throughout the world will increase dramatically. As information policy continues to shape many aspects of society, these international relations will become vital.

Information policy is playing a greater role in the economy leading to the production of goods and services, as well as selling them directly to consumers.{{cn|date=May 2025}} The cost of information varies from a tangible good in that initial costs of the first unit are large and fixed; however, after that, marginal costs are relatively low.{{sfn|MacInnis|2011|p={{page needed|date=May 2025}}}} As an increase from the information services, information can be paralleled to that of manufacturing several years ago.{{cn|date=May 2025}} The digitalization of information allows businesses to make better justified business decisions.{{sfn|MacInnis|2011|p={{page needed|date=May 2025}}}}

      <text bytes="12183" sha1="4z6af18kognxtqsv00sj38wpzt0ykxg" xml:space="preserve">The '''digital firm''' is a kind of organization that has enabled core business relationships through digital networks. In these digital networks are supported by enterprise class technology platforms that have been leveraged within an organization to support critical business functions and services. Some examples of these technology platforms are [[customer relationship management]] (CRM), [[supply chain management]] (SCM), [[enterprise resource planning]] (ERP), [[Knowledge management|knowledge management system]] (KMS), [[enterprise content management]] (ECM), and [[warehouse management system]] (WMS) among others. The purpose of these technology platforms is to digitally enable seamless integration and information exchange within the organization to employees and outside the organization to customers, suppliers, and other business partners.

== History ==

=== Origin of "the digital firm" ===
The term "digital firm" originated, as a concept in a series of [[management information system]]s (MIS) books authored by [[Kenneth C. Laudon]]. &lt;ref name=Laudon /&gt; It provides a new way to describe organizations that operate differently than the traditional [[brick and mortar]] business as a result of broad sweeping changes in technology and global markets. Digital firms place an emphasis on the digitization of business processes and services through sophisticated technology and information systems. These information systems create opportunities for digital firms to decentralize operations, accelerate market readiness and responsiveness, enhance customer interactions, as well as increase efficiencies across a variety of business functions.

=== Acceleration of technology adoption ===
Technology adoption has been increasing as digital firms continually look to achieve greater levels cost savings, competitive advantage, and operational performance optimization. As organizations adopt technology, the internal appetite for additional technologies increases and, in some cases, accelerates.&lt;ref name=Wharton/&gt; This acceleration of technology adoption by digital firms creates a "digital divide".&lt;ref name=Wharton/&gt; Emerging technology is absorbed at varying rates across organizations. This technology divergence can affect competitive dynamics in the marketplace between firms that achieve operational benefits from the technology and firms which have yet to adapt.

While the growth of new technology consumption is not uniform across organizations, the trend for business-driven investment in technology across all markets has and continues to increase. During the span of 1990 to 2006, the gross U.S. domestic investment in information and communications technology, as measured by the U.S. Census Bureau, increased by 170%.&lt;ref name=Census2012/&gt;

The market for [[enterprise resource planning]] (ERP) systems and other packaged applications started to grow substantially during the 1990s to the point that the ERP market alone accounts for approximately $25 billion.&lt;ref name=ERP2/&gt; According to surveys conducted in 2002, nearly "75% of global Fortune 1000 firms had implemented SAP’s ERP suite".&lt;ref name=ERP2/&gt;

Many businesses are aware of the need to further digitalize in the post-[[COVID-19]] climate, but those in less developed areas have traditionally been slower to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Digital adoption through COVID-19 and beyond {{!}} McKinsey |url=https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-covid-19-recovery-will-be-digital-a-plan-for-the-first-90-days |access-date=2022-08-16 |website=www.mckinsey.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Embracing digital: from survival to thriving in the post-COVID-19 world |url=https://www2.deloitte.com/nl/nl/pages/consumer/articles/the-post-covid-19-world-is-digital.html |access-date=2022-08-16 |website=Deloitte Netherlands |language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages ==
Through digital networks and information systems, the digital firm is able to operate core business services and functions continuously and more efficiently. This digital enablement of business processes creates highly dynamic information systems allowing for more efficient and productive management of an organization.

According to the [[European Commission]], as of 2022, across all economic categories, digital enterprises have been more likely than their non-digital counterparts to increase employment. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Digital skills and jobs {{!}} Shaping Europe's digital future |url=https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/digital-skills-and-jobs |access-date=2022-08-16 |website=digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manufacturing (33%) or infrastructure (30%) are the two industries in Europe with the most digital and environmentally friendly businesses. &lt;ref name=":63"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Regional Cohesion in Europe 2021-2022 |url=https://www.eib.org/en/publications-research/economics/surveys-data/eibis-cohesion-report-2021-2022.htm |access-date=2022-08-09 |website=EIB.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, digital enablement of core business functions and services provides an organization with opportunities to:

* Operate business continuously ("Time shifting") &lt;ref name=Laudon /&gt;
* Operate business in a global workplace ("Space shifting") &lt;ref name=Laudon /&gt;
* Adapt business strategies to meet market demands &lt;ref name=Bartel /&gt;
* Create business value from technology investments &lt;ref name=Harvard /&gt;
* Drive efficiency improvements in inventory and supply chain &lt;ref name=Bartel /&gt;
* Enhance the management of customer relationships &lt;ref name=CRM /&gt;
* Improve organizational productivity &lt;ref name=ERP2 /&gt;

== Effects on organizational performance ==
Technology and information systems serve many critical roles in a digital firm by providing technology-driven capabilities that increase operational performance. For example, digital networks and information systems allow organizations to connect and integrate supply chains in ways that are real-time, uninterrupted and highly responsive to market conditions.

Another example of an information system that can increase an organization's performance awareness and management capabilities is a [[real-time business intelligence]] (RTBI) system. A RTBI system can provide a highly responsive and strategic decision support platform for an organization to analyze operational events as they occur. RTBI systems often work closely with [[Operational risk management|organizational risk management]] (ORM) systems in this capacity to increase capabilities around monitoring operational performance and assessing operational risks. These types of information systems can increase an organization's capabilities to effectively manage performance and productivity.

The three main enterprise information systems that can positively affect an organization's performance and productivity are:

=== Enterprise resource planning (ERP) ===
ERP deployments can be complex and require a significant shift in business operations for an organization, but the benefits can be substantial.

After implementation of an ERP system within an organization there are measurable performance and productivity gains that can be directly correlated to the ERP system go-live event.&lt;ref name=ERP2/&gt; This study conducted a detailed analysis of the ERP data produced and found that there was a direct causal relationship between ERP systems and performance gains in an organization.&lt;ref name=ERP2/&gt;

Organizations that deploy ERP systems typically, based on performance and productivity gains, also implement both of the following enterprise platforms as well.&lt;ref name=ERP2/&gt;

=== Customer relationship management (CRM) ===
Organizations leverage CRM systems to improve the overall management of their relationships with customers. CRM systems operate as enterprise platforms that provide digital firms with opportunities to closely manage all aspects of interactions with customers through customer-oriented business processes.&lt;ref name=CRM/&gt;

Organizations which implement CRM systems may encounter some lag time until the CRM productivity affects are fully realized in the firm based on studies.&lt;ref name=CRM/&gt;  However, the lag effects are difficult to measure and based in part on the organization's ability to leverage the new CRM system and adapt to the changes in business operations as a result.&lt;ref name=CRM/&gt;

=== Supply chain management (SCM) ===
Studies of organizations that implemented SCM systems to improve supply chain management capabilities found that those systems had a significant impact on productivity and performance within the organization.&lt;ref name=ERP2/&gt; Additionally, the implementation of SCM and CRM systems differed from an ERP implementation in that organizational performance could be directly correlated "with both the initial purchase and go-live event".&lt;ref name=ERP2/&gt;

SCM and CRM systems are often viewed as "extended enterprise systems" due to the way that they integrate with ERP systems and the benefits that they bring to organizations.&lt;ref name=ERP2/&gt;

The data is generated automatically from a variety of sources, covering places, people, businesses, and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=About knowledge panels - Knowledge Panel Help |url=https://support.google.com/knowledgepanel/answer/9163198?hl=en |access-date=2021-03-15 |website=Google Support}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Your business information in the Knowledge Panel |url=https://support.google.com/business/answer/6331288 |access-date=December 10, 2017 |website=Google My Business Help |publisher=Google Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The information covered by Google's Knowledge Graph grew quickly after launch, tripling its data size within seven months (covering 570 million entities and 18 billion facts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Casey |last=Newton |title=Google's Knowledge Graph tripled in size in seven months |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/googles-knowledge-graph-tripled-in-size-in-seven-months/ |website=[[CNET]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=December 4, 2012 |access-date=December 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;). By mid-2016, Google reported that it held 70 billion facts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=James |last=Vincent |title=Apple boasts about sales; Google boasts about how good its AI is |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/4/13122406/google-phone-event-stats |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=October 4, 2016 |access-date=December 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and answered "roughly one-third" of the 100 billion monthly searches they handled. By May 2020, this had grown to 500 billion facts on 5 billion entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=A reintroduction to our Knowledge Graph and knowledge panels |url= https://blog.google/products/search/about-knowledge-graph-and-knowledge-panels/ |date=2020-05-20|website=Google blog |language=en|access-date=2020-05-26|quote=It’s a system that understands facts and information about entities from materials shared across the web, as well as from open source and licensed databases.

There is no official documentation of how the Google Knowledge Graph is implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1695/paper4.pdf|title=Towards a Definition of Knowledge Graphs|last1=Ehrlinger|first1=Lisa|last2=Wöß|first2=Wolfram|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
According to Google, its information is retrieved from many sources, including the ''[[The World Factbook|CIA World Factbook]]'' and [[Wikipedia]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |last=Singhal |first=Amit |date=May 16, 2012 |title=Introducing the Knowledge Graph: Things, Not Strings |url= http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/05/introducing-knowledge-graph-things-not.html |access-date=September 6, 2014 |work=Google Official Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been criticized for providing answers with neither source attribution nor [[citation]]s.&lt;ref name="wapo"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Dewey |first=Caitlin |date=May 11, 2016 |title=You Probably Haven't Even Noticed Google's Sketchy Quest to Control the World's Knowledge |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/05/11/you-probably-havent-even-noticed-googles-sketchy-quest-to-control-the-worlds-knowledge/ |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160603201137/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/05/11/you-probably-havent-even-noticed-googles-sketchy-quest-to-control-the-worlds-knowledge/ |archive-date=June 3, 2016 |access-date=May 25, 2022 |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Google announced its Knowledge Graph on May 16, 2012, as a way to significantly enhance the value of information returned by Google searches.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Initially available only in English, it was expanded in December 2012 to [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Italian language|Italian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Casey |last=Newton |title=How Google is taking the Knowledge Graph global |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/how-google-is-taking-the-knowledge-graph-global/ |website=[[CNET]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=December 14, 2012 |access-date=December 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Bengali language|Bengali]] support was added in March 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://india.googleblog.com/2017/03/making-it-easier-to-search-in-bengali.html|title=Making it easier to Search in Bengali|work=Official Google India Blog|access-date=2018-01-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Knowledge Graph was powered in part by [[Freebase (database)|Freebase]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In August 2014, ''[[New Scientist]]'' reported that Google had launched a '''Knowledge Vault''' project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Hal |last=Hodson |title=Google's fact-checking bots build vast knowledge bank |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22329832-700-googles-fact-checking-bots-build-vast-knowledge-bank/ |website=[[New Scientist]] |date=August 20, 2014 |access-date=December 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After publication, Google reached out to ''[[Search Engine Land]]'' to explain that Knowledge Vault was a research report, not an active Google service. ''Search Engine Land'' expressed indications that Google was experimenting with "numerous models" for gathering meaning from text.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web |first=Greg |last=Sterling |title=Google "Knowledge Vault" To Power Future Of Search |url=https://searchengineland.com/google-builds-next-gen-knowledge-graph-future-201640 |website=[[Search Engine Land]] |date=August 25, 2014 |access-date=December 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google's Knowledge Vault was meant to deal with facts, automatically gathering and merging information from across the Internet into a knowledge base capable of answering direct questions, such as "Where was [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] born?" In a 2014 report, the Vault was reported to have collected over 1.6 billion facts, 271 million of which were considered "confident facts" deemed to be more than 90% true. It was reported to be different from the Knowledge Graph in that it gathered information automatically instead of relying on crowd-sourced facts compiled by humans.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Features ==
=== Google Knowledge Panel ===
A Google Knowledge Panel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Browne |first1=Ryan |title=Google launches knowledge panels in search results to tackle misinformation about Covid vaccines |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/10/google-search-panels-tackle-misinformation-about-covid-vaccines.html |access-date=28 August 2024 |work=CNBC |date=10 December 2020 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is part of Google search engine result pages, presents an overview of entities such as individuals, organizations, locations, or objects directly within the search interface. This feature uses data from Google Knowledge Graph,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lardinois |first1=Frederic |title=Google Just Got A Whole Lot Smarter, Launches Its Knowledge Graph |url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/05/16/google-just-got-a-whole-lot-smarter-launches-its-knowledge-graph/ |access-date=28 August 2024 |work=TechCrunch |date=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; an extensive database that organizes and interconnects information about entities, enhancing the retrieval and presentation of relevant content to users.

== Criticism ==
=== Lack of source attribution ===
By May 2016, knowledge boxes were appearing for "roughly one-third" of the 100 billion monthly searches the company processed.&lt;ref name="wapo" /&gt; Dario Taraborelli, head of research at the [[Wikimedia Foundation]], told ''[[The Washington Post]]'' that Google's omission of sources in its knowledge boxes "undermines people’s ability to verify information and, ultimately, to develop well-informed opinions". The publication also reported that the boxes are "frequently unattributed", such as a knowledge box on the age of actress [[Betty White]], which is "as unsourced and absolute as if handed down by God".&lt;ref name="wapo" /&gt;

=== Declining Wikipedia article readership ===
According to ''[[The Register]]'' in 2014 the display of direct answers in knowledge panels alongside Google search results caused significant readership declines for [[Wikipedia]], from which the panels obtained some of their information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Andrew |last=Orlowski |title=Google stabs Wikipedia in the front |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/01/13/google_stabs_wikipedia_in_the_front |website=[[The Register]] |date=January 13, 2014 |access-date=December 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2014, ''[[The Daily Dot]]'' noted that "Wikipedia still has no real competitor as far as actual content is concerned. All that's up for grabs are traffic stats. And as a nonprofit, traffic numbers don't equate into revenue in the same way they do for a commercial media site". After the article's publication, a spokesperson for the [[Wikimedia Foundation]], which operates Wikipedia, stated that it "welcomes" the knowledge panel functionality, that it was "looking into" the traffic drops, and that "We've also not noticed a significant drop in search engine referrals. We also have a continuing dialog with staff from Google working on the Knowledge Panel".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Joe |last=Kloc |title=Is Google accidentally killing Wikipedia? |url=https://www.dailydot.com/news/wikipedia-falling-traffic-meaning/ |website=[[The Daily Dot]] |date=January 8, 2014 |access-date=December 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2020 book, [[Dariusz Jemielniak]] noted that as most Google users do not realize that many answers to their questions that appear in the Knowledge Graph come from Wikipedia, this reduces Wikipedia's popularity, and in turn limited the site's ability to raise new funds and attract new volunteers.&lt;ref name="JemielniakPrzegalinska2020"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Dariusz|last1=Jemielniak|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yLDMDwAAQBAJ|title=Collaborative Society|first2=Aleksandra|last2=Przegalinska|date=18 February 2020|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-35645-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bias===
The algorithm has been criticized for presenting biased or inaccurate information, usually because of sourcing information from websites with high [[search engine optimization]]. It had been noted in 2014 that while there was a Knowledge Graph for most major historical or pseudo-historical [[religion|religious]] figures such as [[Moses]], [[Muhammad]] and [[Gautama Buddha]], there was none for [[Jesus]], the central figure of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.seroundtable.com/google-knowledge-graph-jesus-christ-religion-18814.html|title=Why Does Google Exclude Jesus Christ From The Knowledge Graph|date=July 8, 2014|accessdate=May 29, 2016|last=Schwartz|first=Barry|publisher=Search Engine Roundtable}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webpronews.com/google-has-a-jesus-shaped-hole-in-its-graph-2014-07/|title=Google Has a Jesus-Shaped Hole in Its Graph|date=July 8, 2014|accessdate=May 29, 2016|last=Wolford|first=Josh|publisher=WebProNews}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 3, 2021, a knowledge box identified [[Kannada]] as the ugliest language in India, prompting outrage from the Kannada-language community; the state of [[Karnataka]], where most Kannada speakers live, also threatened to sue Google for damaging the public image of the language. Google promptly changed the featured snippet for the search query and issued a formal apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Why Google showed Kannada as 'ugliest language of India': Explained |url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-google-showed-kannada-as-ugliest-language-of-india-explained-101622784047314.html |work=Hindustan Times |date=4 June 2021 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ives |first1=Mike |last2=Mozur |first2=Paul |title=India's 'Ugliest' Language?

A '''knowledge society''' generates, shares, and makes available to all members of the [[society]] knowledge that may be used to improve the [[human condition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Phillips |first1=Fred |last2=Yu |first2=Ching-Ying |last3=Hameed |first3=Tahir |last4=El Akhdary |first4=Mahmoud Abdullah |title=The knowledge society's origins and current trajectory |journal=International Journal of Innovation Studies |date=2017 |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=175–191 |doi=10.1016/j.ijis.2017.08.001 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; A knowledge society differs from an [[information society]] in that the former serves to transform information into resources that allow society to take effective action, while the latter only creates and disseminates the [[raw data]].&lt;ref name="Castelfranchi"&gt;Castelfranchi, C. (2007).  [https://jcom.sissa.it/sites/default/files/documents/Jcom0604(2007)C03.pdf Six critical remarks on science and the construction of the knowledge society].  ''Journal of Science Communication, 6''(4), 1-3.&lt;/ref&gt; The capacity to gather and analyze information has existed throughout [[human history]]. However, the idea of the present-day knowledge society is based on the vast increase in data creation and [[Science communication|information dissemination]] that results from the [[innovation]] of [[Information technology|information technologies]].&lt;ref name="Vallima"&gt;Vallima, J. &amp; Hoffman, D. (2008).  Knowledge society discourse and higher education.  ''Higher Education, 56''(3), 265-285.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[UNESCO]] World Report addresses the definition, content and future of knowledge societies.&lt;ref name="UnitedNations"&gt;United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (2005).  Toward knowledge societies.  ''UNESCO World Report''.  Conde-sur-Noireau, France:  Imprimerie Corlet.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Information and communication technology ==

The growth of [[Information and communication technology]] (ICT) has significantly increased the world's capacity for creation of raw data and the speed at which it is produced. The advent of the [[Internet]] delivered unheard-of quantities of [[information]] to people. The [[evolution]] of the internet from Web 1.0 to [[Web 2.0]] offered individuals tools to connect with each other [[World Wide Web|worldwide]] as well as become content users and producers. Innovation in [[Information technology|digital technologies]] and [[mobile device]]s offers individuals a means to connect anywhere anytime where digital technologies are accessible. Tools of ICT have the potential to transform [[education]], [[training]], [[employment]] and access to life-sustaining resources for all members of society.&lt;ref name="VanWeert"&gt;van Weert, T. J. (2006).  Education of the twenty-first century:  New professionalism in lifelong learning, knowledge development and knowledge sharing.  ''Education and Information Technologies, 11''(3), 217-237.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
However, this capacity for individuals to produce and use data on a global scale does not necessarily result in [[knowledge]] creation. Contemporary media delivers seemingly endless amounts of information and yet, the information alone does not create knowledge. For knowledge creation to take place, reflection is required to create [[awareness]], meaning and understanding. The improvement of human circumstances requires critical analysis of information to develop the knowledge that assists humankind.&lt;ref name="Castelfranchi" /&gt; Absent reflection and [[critical thinking]], information can actually become "non-knowledge", that which is false or inaccurate.&lt;ref name="Innerarity"&gt;Innerarity, D. (2012).  Power and knowledge:  The politics of the knowledge society, ''European Journal of Social Theory, 16''(1), 3-16.&lt;/ref&gt; The anticipated Semantic Web 3.0 and Ubiquitous Web 4.0 will move both information and knowledge creation forward in their capacities to use intelligence to digitally create meaning independent of user-driven ICT.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, P.L. (2010).  Applying social systems thinking and community informatics thinking in education.  In Rudestam, K.E., &amp; Schoenholtz-Read, J. (Eds.), 91-128.  ''Handbook of online learning''.  Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berners-Lee, T. (2009, Mar 13).  Tim Berners-Lee:  The next web of open, linked data [Video].  Retrieved from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM6XIICm_qo&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social theory ==

The [[social theory]] of a knowledge society explains how knowledge is fundamental to the [[politics]], [[economics]], and culture of [[Modernity|modern society.]] Associated ideas include the [[knowledge economy]] created by economists and the [[learning society]] created by educators.&lt;ref name="Vallima" /&gt; Knowledge is a commodity to be traded for economic prosperity. In a knowledge society, [[individual]]s, [[Community|communities]], and organizations produce knowledge-intensive work. [[Peter Drucker]] viewed knowledge as a key [[Economic resources|economic resource]] and coined the term [[knowledge worker]] in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Drucker, P.F. (1969).  ''The age of discontinuity:  Guidelines to our changing society''.  New York, NY:  Harper &amp; Row&lt;/ref&gt; Fast-forward to the present day, and in this knowledge-intensive environment, knowledge begets knowledge, new competencies develop, and the result is innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Paavola, S. &amp; Hakkarainen, K. (2005).  The knowledge creation metaphor:  An emergent epistemological approach to learning.  Science &amp; Education, 14, 535-557.&lt;/ref&gt;   
   
A knowledge society promotes [[human rights]] and offers equal, inclusive, and [[universal access to all knowledge]] creation. The UNESCO World Report establishes four principles that are essential for development of an equitable knowledge society:&lt;ref name="UnitedNations" /&gt;
*[[Cultural diversity]]	
*Equal access to [[education]]
*[[Universal Access|Universal access]] to information (in the [[public domain]])
*[[Freedom of speech|Freedom of expression]]

However, they acknowledge that the [[digital divide]] is an obstacle to achievement of genuine knowledge societies. Access to the internet is available to 39 percent of the world's population.&lt;ref&gt;Sanou, B. (2013).  The world in 2013:  ICT fact and figures.  Retrieved from http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Documents/facts/ICTFactsFigures2013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This statistic represents growth as well as a continued gap. Among the many challenges that contribute to a global digital divide are issues regarding economic resources, [[geography]], age, [[gender]], [[language]], [[education]], social and cultural background, [[employment]] and [[Disability|disabilities]].&lt;ref name="UnitedNations" /&gt;

== Politics ==

To reduce the span of the digital divide, [[Leadership|leaders]] and [[Politician|policymakers]] worldwide must first develop an understanding of knowledge societies and, second, create and deploy initiatives that will universally benefit all populations. The public expects politicians and public institutions to act rationally and rely on relevant knowledge for [[decision-making]].  Yet, in many cases, there are no definitive answers for some of the issues that impact [[human]]kind. [[Science]] is no longer viewed as the provider of unquestionable knowledge, and sometimes raises more uncertainty in its search for knowledge. The very advancement of knowledge creates the existence of increased [[ignorance]] or non-knowledge.&lt;ref name="Gross"&gt;Gross, M. (2010). ''Ignorance and Surprise: Science, Society, and Ecological Design.'' Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that public policy must learn to manage doubt, [[probability]], [[risk]] and uncertainty while making the best decisions possible.&lt;ref name="Innerarity" /&gt;

To confront the uncertainty that comes from an increase in both knowledge and the resulting lack of knowledge, members of a society disagree and make decisions using [[Justification (theology)|justification]] and [[observation]] of consequences.&lt;ref name="Innerarity" /&gt; Public policy may operate with the intent to prevent the worst possible outcome, versus find the perfect solution.  [[Democratization]] of expert knowledge occurs when a knowledge society produces and relies on more experts. Expert knowledge is no longer exclusive to certain individuals, professional or organizations. If in a knowledge society, knowledge is a public good to which all people have access, any individual may also serve as a creator of knowledge and receive credit as an expert. Since politicians rely on expert knowledge for decision-making, the layperson who may lack specialized knowledge might hold a view that serves as expertise to the political process.

== Education ==

As technologies are deployed to improve global information access, the role of education will continue to grow and change. Education is viewed as a basic human right.&lt;ref name="UnitedNations" /&gt; For a society where [[Reading (process)|reading]] and [[counting]] are a requisite for [[Activities of daily living|daily living]], skills in reading, [[writing]], and [[Elementary arithmetic|basic arithmetic]] are critical for future learning. However, in a knowledge society, education is not restricted to school. The advent of ICT allows learners to seek information and develop knowledge at any time and any place where access is available and unrestricted. In these circumstances, the skill of learning to learn is one of the most important tools to help people acquire formal and informal education.&lt;ref name="UnitedNations" /&gt; In a knowledge society supported by ICT, the ability to locate, classify and sort information is essential. Equipped with this skill, the use of ICT becomes an active versus a passive endeavor and integral to literacy and lifelong learning.&lt;ref name="UnitedNations" /&gt;

One marker of a knowledge society is continuous innovation that demands [[lifelong learning]], knowledge development, and [[knowledge sharing]]. The institution of education will need to become responsive to changing demands. Education [[professional]]s will need to learn along with everyone else, and as leaders of changing designs in learning, they will serve as a bridge between [[technology]] and [[Education|teaching]].&lt;ref name="VanWeert" /&gt; The ability to individually reflect on personal learning requirements and seek knowledge in whatever method is appropriate characterizes lifelong learning. One model that supports this type of learning is the [[W. Edwards Deming]] [[PDCA|Plan-do-check-act cycle]]&lt;ref name="VanWeert" /&gt; that promotes [[Continual improvement process|continuous improvement]]. Educational professionals will need to prepare learners to be accountable for their own lifelong learning.

'''Children's use of information''' is an issue in [[ethics]] and [[child development]]. Information is learned from many different sources and '''source monitoring''' (see also [[source-monitoring error]]) is important in understanding how people use information and decide which information is [[credibility|credible]]. 

Consider the example of a parent whose child has been diagnosed with [[hyperactivity]]; the parent searches the internet for information, reads books, participates in an online chat room with other parents in the same situation, and consults various medical professionals. Some of these sources will be credible (contain reliable information), and others will not. To be well-informed, the parent must filter information according to the reliability of the source. Children learn about the world in much the same way. They are told things by numerous people (e.g., teachers, parents, siblings, and friends), see things on the television or internet, and read information in books. Can children be effective consumers of information? At what age are they able to do this? How do they deal with ambiguous resources? This page will detail answers to those questions (and others) by drawing on peer-reviewed scientific research.

==The development of source monitoring==
Young children have more difficulty with understanding and recalling the sources of information than adults do.&lt;ref name="Lindsay, D. S. 1991"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lindsay | first1 = D. S. | last2 = Johnson | first2 = M. K. | last3 = Kwon | first3 = P. | year = 1991 | title = Developmental changes in memory source monitoring | journal = Journal of Experimental Child Psychology | volume = 52 | issue = 3| pages = 297–318 | doi=10.1016/0022-0965(91)90065-z | pmid=1770330}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[episodic memory]] improves throughout childhood, development in the area of source monitoring tends to occur between the ages of 3 and 8 years.&lt;ref name = "Roberts 2002"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roberts | first1 = K. P. | year = 2002 | title = Children's ability to distinguish between memories from multiple sources: Implications for the quality and accuracy of eyewitness statements | url = http://scholars.wlu.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1095&amp;context=psyc_faculty| journal = Developmental Review | volume = 22 | issue = 3| pages = 403–435 | doi = 10.1016/S0273-2297(02)00005-9 | s2cid = 59933611 | url-access = subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt; At 3 years, children who are able to immediately recognize the source of the information they obtain have difficulty recalling this information after a short delay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gopnik | first1 = A. | author-link=Alison Gopnik | last2 = Graf | first2 = P. | year = 1988 | title = Knowing how you know: Young children's ability to identify and remember the sources of their beliefs | journal = Child Development | volume = 59 | issue = 5| pages = 1366–1371 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1988.tb01505.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of source monitoring is gradual, and children achieve and display competency in certain aspects of source monitoring before others.&lt;ref name = "Roberts 2002"/&gt; The developmental trajectory of source monitoring provides insight into what cognitive factors are necessary prerequisites. While there is no generally accepted unified theory for the development of source monitoring, five major theories contribute ideas about how source monitoring develops in children: source monitoring theory, [[fuzzy-trace theory]], [[schema theory]], person-based perspective, and the mental-state reasoning model.

===Source monitoring theory===
According to source monitoring theory, the source of information is attributed through a decision-making process, where source is inferred based on various characteristics inherent in the memory itself.&lt;ref name="Lindsay, D. S. 1991"/&gt; This means that the sources are not directly [[Encoding (memory)|encoded]], but rather [[Reconstructive memory|reconstructed]], when information is recalled. This decision-making process can either be through automatic, unconscious processing, or through heightened demanding and systematic processing that may require reasoning, and the retrieval of supporting memories. This theory implicates the development of episodic memory and memory strategies in the development of source monitoring more generally.

===Fuzzy-trace theory===
{{see also|Fuzzy-trace theory}}
Fuzzy-trace theory hypothesizes that the source-monitoring errors that children make are caused by problems with memory [[Storage (memory)|storage]] and [[Recall (memory)|retrieval]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brainerd | first1 = C. J. | last2 = Reyna | first2 = V. F. | year = 1990 | title = Gist is the grist: Fuzzy-trace theory and the new intuitionism | journal = Developmental Review | volume = 10 | issue = 1| pages = 3–47 | doi=10.1016/0273-2297(90)90003-m}}&lt;/ref&gt; Memories are simultaneously stored in two different formats: the "gist" level (extracted from the experience), and the "verbatim" representation (information in exact detail). It is proposed that the source of information is encoded in memory as a verbatim detail. Memories for verbatim details decay more quickly over time than gist representations, and young children demonstrate faster decay of verbatim information than older children or adults. Younger children are more likely to experience memory intrusions due to weaker memory traces, which leads to a susceptibility to misleading information replacing memory traces from a previous event.&lt;ref name="welch-ross1997"/&gt; For this reason, developmental changes in episodic memory performance are viewed as the driving factor in source monitoring development.

===Schema theory===
{{see also|Schema (psychology)}}
Schema theory, as a derivative of [[script theory]], states that after repeated exposure to similar events, individuals form a general representation of what typically happens.&lt;ref&gt;Farrar, M. J., &amp; Goodman, G. S. (1990). Developmental differences in the relation between scripts and episodic memory: Do they exist? In Knowing and remembering in young children, Fivush, Robyn, Hudson, Judith A. eds., (pp. 30-64). Cambridge University Press, New York, NY&lt;/ref&gt; Some details are the same at each instance of repeated events, and others can vary from instance to instance. In the script for what usually happens, there is a "slot" for each variable detail and the detail for a particular time is chosen from a list of possible variations. If source information is encoded as a slot, errors in source monitoring can be the result of incorrect retrieval of a specific detail. This framework allows for the storage of a large amount of detailed information about specific events, however is very cognitively demanding for children. Because of their limited cognitive resources, young children require more experience with repeated events in order to generate a schema. Details that vary from instance to instance can be lost, and children rely instead on the generalized event representation when attempting to recall a particular instance. The main assumption is that the development of source monitoring depends on an increase in cognitive processing capacity.

===Person-based perspective===
Person-based perspective emphasizes [[Prospective memory|prospective processes]]. Prospective processes relate actions to one another through operations such as sequencing and planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ratner | first1 = H. H. | last2 = Foley | first2 = M. A. | year = 1996 | title = A unifying framework for the development of children's activity memory | journal = Advances in Child Development and Behavior | volume = 25 | pages = 33–105 | doi = 10.1016/S0065-2407(08)60050-6 | pmid = 7847174 | isbn = 9780120097258 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These processes are affected by the perspective taken (self vs. other) or the goals and meaning to the individual. The meaning attached to the goal of an action can interfere with source monitoring by removing attention from the source details.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Foley | first1 = M. A. | last2 = Ratner | first2 = H. H. | year = 1998 | title = Distinguishing between memories for thoughts and deeds: The role of prospective processing in children's source monitoring | journal = British Journal of Developmental Psychology | volume = 16 | issue = 4| pages = 465–484 | doi=10.1111/j.2044-835x.1998.tb00765.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The person-based perspective is social-cognitive in nature (more so than other theories of source monitoring) and assumes that development is reliant on socialization and [[theory of mind]] development.

===Mental-state reasoning model===
The mental-state reasoning model highlights possible mechanisms behind young children's suggestibility.&lt;ref&gt;Welch-Ross, M. (2000). A mental-state reasoning model of suggestibility and memory source monitoring. In Children's source monitoring, Roberts, Kim P., Blades, Mark, eds., (pp. 227-255). Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Publishers, Mahwah, NJ&lt;/ref&gt; Children who have difficulty with reasoning about conflicting [[mental representation]]s are likely to overwrite their original memories with misinformation because they cannot reconcile two contradicting views of what actually occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bright-Paul | first1 = A. | last2 = Jarrold | first2 = C. | last3 = Wright | first3 = D. B. | year = 2008 | title = Theory of mind development influences suggestibility and source monitoring | doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.44.4.1055 | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 44 | issue = 4| pages = 1055–1068 | pmid = 18605834 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Source monitoring and the understanding of knowledge states, play a key role in resisting suggestions. The development of source monitoring is presumed to be based on better understanding of knowledge states, [[metacognition]] and theory of mind.

==The origins of knowledge==
Being aware of how we have acquired information is particularly difficult for young children (specifically 3- to 5-year-olds). After feeling a soft ball, 3- and 4-year-olds can correctly identify whether they know the ball is soft or hard, but cannot always say how they know. Perhaps it is because they felt the ball, saw the ball, or were told it was soft. The ability to recognize the origin of their knowledge requires the understanding of how knowledge is acquired.&lt;ref name = "O'Neill 1992"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = O'Neill | first1 = D. K. | last2 = Astington | first2 = J. W. | last3 = Flavell | first3 = J. H. | year = 1992 | title = Young children's understanding of the role that sensory experiences play in knowledge acquisition | journal = Child Development | volume = 63 | issue = 2| pages = 474–490 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1992.tb01641.x| pmid = 1611948 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Knowledge and justification===
When asked '''knowledge questions''' ("Do you know what is in the box?") then '''justification questions''' ("How do [or why don't] you know what is in the box?"), children who can correctly answer are able to reflect on knowledge that they have gained from a particular source and should be able to identify the source of information.&lt;ref name = "O'Neill 1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Wimmer 1988"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wimmer | first1 = H. | last2 = Hogrefe | last3 = Perner | first3 = J. | year = 1988 | title = Children's understanding of informational access as source of knowledge | journal = Child Development | volume = 59 | issue = 2| pages = 386–396 | doi=10.2307/1130318| jstor = 1130318 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

3- and 4-year-olds are better at answering these questions when the questions refer to themselves in comparison to referring to another person. When these children are shown a hidden object they can correctly report their perceptual access (responding correctly to "Did you look into the box?") and their knowledge access of what is in the box (responding correctly to "Do you know [not know] what is in the box?").&lt;ref name = "Wimmer 1988"/&gt; Despite their ability to answer correctly when referring to the self, 3- and 4-year-olds have difficulty responding to the "other's" knowledge, where they deny the "other" has the knowledge. 3- and 4-year-olds can correctly identify that the other person has in fact looked in a box, but when asked "Does [other] know what is in the box?" the child will deny that the other person knows what is in the box.&lt;ref name = "Wimmer 1988"/&gt; The key assumption is then that although children are aware that perceptual access is needed, they are unable to acknowledge that the knowledge was gained from perceptual access.&lt;ref name = "Wimmer 1988"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pratt | first1 = C. | last2 = Bryant | first2 = P. | year = 1990 | title = Young children understand that looking leads to knowing (so long as they are looking into a single barrel) | journal = Child Development | volume = 61 | issue = 4| pages = 973–982 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1990.tb02835.x| pmid = 2209200 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gaining knowledge through looking, touching, and asking===
Gaining knowledge is knowing how to acquire new information. The ability to recognize how specific knowledge can be gained by perceptual access (looking, feeling or smelling) is the understanding of Aspectuality. '''Aspectuality''' understanding is the awareness that an object is made up of many different properties (colour, weight, odour), which can be determined by a specific perceptual action (looking, feeling, smelling).&lt;ref name = "O'Neill 1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Waters 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Waters | first1 = G. M. | last2 = Beck | first2 = S. R. | year = 2012 | title = How should we question young children's understanding of aspectuality? | journal = The British Journal of Developmental Psychology | volume = 30 | issue = 3| pages = 376–392 | doi = 10.1111/j.2044-835X.2011.02044.x | pmid = 22882369 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Identifying the colour of a car outside the window could involve asking someone for the information or looking out the window. In most cases, adults would acquire this knowledge from simply looking out the window. However, not all information can be gained in this manner. If you were asked to find out how old the driver of the car is, simply looking would not provide accurate information; you would have to ask. These two situations are dependent on whether the information being sought out is visible or invisible (respectively).&lt;ref name = "Fitneva 2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fitneva | first1 = S. A. | last2 = Lam | first2 = N. H. L. | last3 = Dunfield | first3 = K. A. | year = 2013 | title = The development of children's information gathering: To look or to ask? | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 49 | issue = 3| pages = 533–542 | doi = 10.1037/a0031326 | pmid = 23316769 | hdl = 21.11116/0000-0002-5F86-D | hdl-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge development depends on children's ability to efficiently pursue their informational goal. Children do not always make the most effective or efficient decision when acquiring new information.&lt;ref name = "Fitneva 2013"/&gt;

====Age differences====
6-year-olds are able to distinguish when gaining knowledge requires looking (the information is visible) or when gaining knowledge requires asking (the information is invisible). However, 4-year-olds do not perform as consistently. Even with an [[expert]] present, 4-year-olds will [[estimation|overestimate]] the knowledge they can gain through looking. However, when the information to be gained is regarding a group of friends and the expert is a friend of the group, 4-year-olds tend to overestimate knowledge acquisition through asking.&lt;ref name = "Fitneva 2013"/&gt;

When given access to pairs of objects, which could either be identified by seeing (identical objects: different in colour) or by touch/feeling (identical objects: 1 soft, 1 hard), children perform relatively well, generally recognizing when they have adequate information and when they have inadequate information (i.e., knowing the object is blue after seeing it or knowing the object is soft after feeling it).&lt;ref name = "O'Neill 1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Robinson 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robinson | first1 = E. J. | last2 = Haigh | first2 = S. N. | last3 = Pendle | first3 = J. E. C. | year = 2008 | title = Children's working understanding of the knowledge gained from seeing and feeling | url = http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/63/1/WRAP_Robinson_Robinson__Haigh__Pendle__2008.pdf| journal = Developmental Science | volume = 11 | issue = 2| pages = 299–305 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2008.00676.x | pmid = 18333983 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But, when young children are not given access (of seeing or feeling), they have difficulty predicting and identifying which mode of access would allow them to identify the object.&lt;ref name = "Robinson 2008"/&gt; In this case, 3- and 4-year-olds overestimate the knowledge that could be gained through feeling the object.&lt;ref name = "O'Neill 1992"/&gt; 3- and 4-year-olds may not{{weasel inline|date=May 2025}} understand the perceptual access needed to acquire the specific knowledge.

===Language and question phrasing===
Waters and Beck (2012) state "understanding the link between perceptual access and consequent information (knowledge access) is a crucial component in the development of [[theory of mind]]". In a typical adult population, change in the phrasing of a particular question would not affect the understanding of what action needs to occur. "What colour is the bike that is outside?" or "Is the bike red?" should not change the action of ''looking'' to gain the needed information. However, children's performance is susceptible to this type of question phrasing.&lt;ref name = "Waters 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Doherty | first1 = M. J. | last2 = Perner | first2 = J. | year = 1998 | title = Metalinguistic awareness and theory of mind: Just two words for the same thing? | journal = Cognitive Development | volume = 13 | issue = 3| pages = 279–305 | doi=10.1016/s0885-2014(98)90012-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Perner | first1 = J. | last2 = Rendl | first2 = B | last3 = Garnham | first3 = A. | year = 2007 | title = Objects of desire, thought, and reality: Problems of anchoring discourse referents in development | journal = Mind &amp; Language | volume = 22 | issue = 5| pages = 475–513 | doi=10.1111/j.1468-0017.2007.00317.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are language effects on knowledge access through 3 different question types:&lt;ref name = "Waters 2012" /&gt;

#'''Identity''': "Find out ''which one'' is in the tunnel",
#'''Dimension''': "Find out ''what colour'' the one in the tunnel is"
#'''Aspect''': "Find out if the one in the tunnel ''is the red one'' or ''the blue one''".

4- and 5-year-olds are more likely to respond correctly to aspect and dimension questions in comparison to identity questions.&lt;ref name = "Waters 2012"/&gt; Aspect and dimension questions are more explicit, which may be why performance is better in these categories. Identity questions require more cognitive effort as one has to remember how the objects were similar and how they differed.

==Judging the credibility of sources and understanding of trust==
Much of people's knowledge about the world is not obtained from direct experience, but indirectly from what other people or sources tell them. With widespread use of the internet people have access to nearly unlimited sources of information. Some of that information might be conflicting, and different sources of information vary in their accuracy and credibility. People can also deliberately [[deception|deceive]], be misunderstood, or be mistaken.&lt;ref name="Nurmsoo2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nurmsoo | first1 = E. | last2 = Robinson | first2 = E. J. | year = 2009 | title = Children's trust in previously inaccurate informants who were well or poorly informed: When past errors can be excused | url = https://kar.kent.ac.uk/32065/1/Nurmsoo%20%26%20Robinson%202009a.pdf| journal = Child Development | volume = 80 | issue = 1| pages = 23–27 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2008.01243.x | pmid=19236390}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important that people develop the necessary skills to assess the accuracy of what they are being told.

===Adults' credibility judgments===
Adults make credibility judgments based on two factors: expertise and trustworthiness. For example, we might trust information from published research articles more than information from blogs because we know that anyone can write a blog, but scientists (experts) who write peer-reviewed articles are highly trained. With regards to trustworthiness, adults are less likely to believe someone who they think is trying to deceive them, and they take into account the intentions of the information-provider. For example, if someone's intention is to sell you something, you might be more skeptical of the accuracy of the information they provide because their motives cause you to question their honesty. Adults can effectively use these cues to make judgments about the credibility of different sources, but whether children can also do so is an important area for research.

===Children's ability to make credibility judgments===
Even very young children show an early sensitivity to issues of source credibility. By the age of 4, children show similar patterns to adults in a preference for perception over testimony; that is, they would rather see something with their own eyes than be told about it. Children also feel more confident in their knowledge when they have directly perceived it than if they have been told by someone else, even if the speaker is well informed.&lt;ref name="Robinson2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robinson | first1 = E. J. | last2 = Haigh | first2 = S. N. | last3 = Nurmsoo | first3 = E. | year = 2008 | title = Children's working understanding of knowledge sources: Confidence in knowledge gained from testimony | url = https://kar.kent.ac.uk/32060/1/Robinson%20Haigh%20%26%20Nurmsoo%202008.pdf| journal = Cognitive Development | volume = 23 | pages = 105–118 | doi=10.1016/j.cogdev.2007.05.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, children are not always able to directly perceive information, and they learn much of what they know from others. Some people are more [[credibility|credible]] sources of information than others, so children must actively evaluate information and decide whether or not to believe it. There are many factors or cues that children, by the age of 4, take into consideration when making judgements about whether or not to trust what a person says. For instance, [[knowledge]] and experience, [[trait theory|traits]], [[motivation]]s, age, and reasoning or support.

====Credibility judgments based on knowledge and experience====
Young children have a reputation for [[credulity]], or believing something without having any proof that it is true. Young children often [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]] what adults tell them, especially when they have no prior knowledge or expectations about the topic of the testimony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jaswal | first1 = V. K. | last2 = Carrington Croft | first2 = A. | last3 = Setia | first3 = A. R. | last4 = Cole | first4 = C. A. | year = 2010 | title = Young children have a specific, highly robust bias to trust testimony | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 21 | issue = 10| pages = 1541–1547 | doi=10.1177/0956797610383438 | pmid=20855905 | pmc=3507998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because children tend to interact with adults who are more knowledgeable than themselves, if they have no reason to believe otherwise, they will trust what adults tell them. In particular, 3-year-olds’ tendency to believe others is based on a selective bias to trust what people tell them. This selective trust is adaptive in the early years as they are learning language and their way around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baier | first1 = A | year = 1986 | title = Trust and anti-trust | journal = Ethics | volume = 96 | issue = 2| pages = 231–260 | doi=10.1086/292745| s2cid = 159454549 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children have difficulty disregarding information provided to them, even if the source has been unreliable in the past. 3-year-olds will often continue to believe what a person tells them even after being repeatedly deceived by that person, but 4-year-olds are far better able to disregard this unreliable information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mascaro | first1 = O. | last2 = Sperber | first2 = D. | year = 2009 | title = The moral, epistemic, and mind- reading components of children's vigilance towards deception | doi = 10.1016/j.cognition.2009.05.012| journal = Cognition | volume = 112 | issue = 3| pages = 367–380 | pmid = 19540473 | s2cid = 7087125 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 3-year-olds are better at making trust judgments when they are able to choose between two sources of knowledge, rather than deciding whether or not to believe a single person, and in this situation they are often able to choose the more reliable of two speakers.&lt;ref name="Lane2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lane | first1 = J.

====Credibility judgments based on traits and motivation====
Almost all human institutions (e.g., family, community, business, government) are built on a foundation of [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]].&lt;ref name="Xu2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Xu | first1 = F. | last2 = Evans | first2 = A.

(1999). Selected philosophical works. Indianapolis, IN: Hackett Publishing Company, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; There are various schools of philosophical thought that posits honesty to be morally right and lying to be morally wrong. On one end of the continuum, philosophers like Bok,&lt;ref&gt;Bok, S. (1978). Lying: Moral choice in public and private life. New York, NY: Random House.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]],&lt;ref&gt;Kant, I. (1949). [[On a supposed right to lie from altruistic motives]]. In L.W. Beck (Ed.), Critical of practical reason and other writings (pp.346–350). Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and St. Augustine&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, St. (1952). Treaties on various issues. Washington, DC: Catholic University of America Press.&lt;/ref&gt; hold a [[Deontological ethics|deontological]] view that focuses on intrinsic duties relating to the treatment of others. In other words, telling the truth is intrinsically right and lying is intrinsically wrong. On the other end of the continuum is the [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] view that emphasizes the greater good, specifically with respect to the outcome of one's act. Therefore, lying and its moral implications are context dependent.&lt;ref&gt;see for example, Austin, J. L. (1962). How to do things with words. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In some situations, such as when being polite to spare another person's feelings, making a "prosocial lie" or deliberate false statement are endorsed.

Children consider motivation, as well as traits, when deciding whom to seek information from and whom to believe. In both Eastern and Western cultures, both adults and children adhere to the utilitarian perspective when giving moral evaluations of truths and lies in different social situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = See | last2 = Fu | first2 = G. | last3 = Evans | first3 = A. D. | last4 = Wang | first4 = L. | last5 = Lee | first5 = K. | year = 2008 | title = Lying in the name of collective good: A developmental study | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2008.00695.x | journal = Developmental Science | volume = 11 | issue = 4| pages = 495–503 | pmc = 2570108 | pmid=18576957}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of people's characteristics, children tend to place trust in people who are honest, smart, or [[Kindness|kind]] over people who are dishonest, not smart, or not kind.&lt;ref name="Lane2013" /&gt; However, they also consider a person's intent or [[motivation]]. From age 7, children consider both [[honesty]] and [[wikt:benevolence|benevolence]] when making trust judgments about other people, and older children are more likely to trust people who tell prosocial lies (to avoid hurting another person's feelings or to help another person) than young children.&lt;ref name="Xu2013" /&gt; For younger children, honesty is more important than a person's intention. As children get older, they increasingly attend to motivation as a key factor. The relationship between telling the truth and trusting a person is stable, but when it comes to lying, children consider the motivation of the speaker when deciding whether or not to trust them.

====Credibility judgments based on age and reliability====
Children evaluate the [[credibility]] of a speaker by evaluating how reliable that person has been in the past and can make predictions about a speaker based on their age.&lt;ref name="Jaswal2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jaswal | first1 = V. K. | last2 = Neely | first2 = L. A. | year = 2006 | title = Adults don't always know best: Preschoolers use past reliability over age when learning new words | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 17 | issue = 9| pages = 757–758 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01778.x | pmid=16984291| s2cid = 41301338 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Children as young as 3 years old prefer to trust an unfamiliar adult rather than an unfamiliar child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Taylor | first1 = M. | last2 = Cartwright | first2 = B.S. | last3 = Bowden | first3 = T. | year = 1991 | title = Perspective taking and theory of mind: Do children predict interpretive diversity as a function of differences in observers' knowledge? | journal = Child Development | volume = 62 | issue = 6| pages = 1334–1351 | doi=10.2307/1130810| jstor = 1130810 | pmid = 1786719 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When considering both age and reliability, age is often the primary cue used to determine another's credibility. For example, 3- and 4-year-olds found adults to be more trustworthy than peers, unless the peer demonstrated greater reliability (i.e., adult incorrectly mislabelled objects, whereas peer correctly labelled them).&lt;ref name="Jaswal2006" /&gt; Children also consider both the prior history of accuracy and the level of perceptual access the speaker has when they provide information. Young children spontaneously keep track of the prior history of a person's accuracy or inaccuracy (reliability) and prefer to learn from someone with a good track record.&lt;ref name="Birch2008" /&gt; Children commonly interpret the speaker's history of inaccuracy as a lasting trait and so the speaker is considered an unreliable informant, at least within the domain they have been wrong about. However, under certain conditions, children may excuse a person's past inaccuracy and later [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]] that person for information. If a speaker has limited information (e.g., lack of perceptual access) in making a claim – for example, inaccurately identifying a toy while blindfolded – then children as young as 3 years old appropriately excuse their past inaccuracy especially when they are later well-informed.&lt;ref name="Nurmsoo2009" /&gt; On the other hand, if a speaker has full access to information while making an inaccurate claim, children continue to regard him/her as unreliable.

====Credibility judgments based on reasoning or support====
Young children appreciate that people generally think and act sensibly when reasons are present, and they can evaluate a claim by assessing the quality of the reasoning provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wellman | first1 = H. M. | last2 = Bartsch | first2 = K. | year = 1988 | title = Young children's reasoning about beliefs | doi = 10.1016/0010-0277(88)90021-2 | journal = Cognition | volume = 30 | issue = 3| pages = 239–277 | pmid = 3215003 | hdl = 2027.42/27034 | s2cid = 37767773 | hdl-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, children create an epistemic profile of a person based on the quality of the reasons they offer when making a claim.&lt;ref name="Koenig2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Koenig | first1 = M. A. | year = 2012 | title = Beyond semantic accuracy: Preschoolers evaluate a speaker's reasons | journal = Child Development | volume = 83 | issue = 3| pages = 1051–1063 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2012.01742.x | pmid=22417290}}&lt;/ref&gt; As young as 3 years old, children understand the difference between weak versus strong reasoning to support a statement. Children are more likely to [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]] someone when strong support is provided through: reliable testimony ("My teacher told me there's a book in the bag. I think that there's a book"), looking ("Before I came here, I looked and saw a ball in the bag. I think there's a ball in there"), and [[inference]] ("It's a backpack. Backpacks hold books. I think there's a book in there").&lt;ref name="Koenig2012" /&gt; On the other hand, [[desire]] ("I like crayons. I want there to be crayons in the bag. I think that there are crayons in there"), pretense ("I like to pretend. I'm going to pretend that there's a sandwich in the bag. I think there's a sandwich in there"), and guessing ("I don't know. I'm going to guess that there's a toy in the bag") are not viewed as strong support for a claim.&lt;ref name="Koenig2012" /&gt; Children recognize that the mental states that they and others may hold are not always reliable means for drawing specific conclusions. 3- and 4-year-olds can also choose the more reasonable of two people and continue to seek, as well as, accept new information from the more credible person (the one who had better reasons in the past).&lt;ref name="Koenig2012" /&gt;

===Children's development of distrust===
People are not always reliable in their provision of information and it is important to be able to differentiate between good sources and bad sources. Assessing someone's reliability is based not only on the knowledgeability of the speaker, but their motives/[[intention]]s as well. People may not always be motivated to tell the [[truth]]; instead, they may potentially [[lie]] to promote their own interest,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heyman | first1 = G. D. | last2 = Legare | first2 = C. H. | year = 2005 | title = Children's evaluation of sources of information about traits | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 41 | issue = 4| pages = 636–647 | doi=10.1037/0012-1649.41.4.636 | pmid=16060810}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the interest of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heyman | first1 = G.

E. | last2 = Liu | first2 = D. | last3 = Heyman | first3 = G. D. | year = 2011 | title = The development of distrust | journal = Child Development | volume = 82 | issue = 5| pages = 1372–1380 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2011.01629.x| pmc = 3169730 | pmid=21824130}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, 4-year-olds are more sceptical and could differentiate between helpers and trickers, but have no preference in choosing whom to accept advice from.&lt;ref name="Vanderbilt2011" /&gt; There may be a mismatch between knowledge and behaviour among 4-year-olds, in which they do not understand the implications of their knowledge or how to successfully apply it to their behaviour. 5-year-olds systematically preferred advice from helpers.&lt;ref name="Vanderbilt2011" /&gt; Ultimately [[theory of mind]], or children's understanding of mental states, is related to selective trust in helpers (versus trickers). Beginning at 5 years old, children use a person's prior history of deception to make reliability judgments about that person.&lt;ref name="Vanderbilt2011" /&gt;

== Metacognition ==
[[Metacognition]] is an ability that allows people to think about their own thinking process, and how to use their thinking process to help themselves learn better. Metacognition includes two separate abilities: (1) knowledge of cognition and (2) regulation of cognition.&lt;ref name="schraw1994"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schraw | first1 = G. | last2 = Dennison | first2 = R. S. | year = 1994 | title = Assessing metacognitive awareness | journal = [[Contemporary Educational Psychology]] | volume = 19 | issue = 4| pages = 460–475 | doi=10.1006/ceps.1994.1033}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="brown1987"&gt;Brown, A. L. (1987). Metacognition, executive control, self-regulation, and other more mysterious mechanisms. In F. E. Weinert &amp; R. H. Kluwe (Eds.), Metacognition, motivation, and understanding (pp. 65-116). Hillsdale, New Jersey: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge of one's thinking process is not enough to regulate an individual's behaviour, and are required to use specific strategies to help them regulate their behaviour.&lt;ref name="schraw1994" /&gt;&lt;ref name="brown1987" /&gt;

===Knowing you don't know===
An important skill children need to learn is being able to identify when a message is incomplete and they don't have enough information to make an accurate interpretation. Being aware that an ambiguous situation has arisen is difficult for young children. Children accurately "know when they know", but often overestimate when they don't know.&lt;ref name="beck2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="robinson1982"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robinson | first1 = E. J. | last2 = Robinson | first2 = W.

Despite incorrectly stating that they "know" something, children are still capable of changing their response upon hearing contradicting information to an initial interpretation and/or event.&lt;ref name="beck2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="robinson1985"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robinson | first1 = E. J. | last2 = Whittaker | first2 = S. J. | year = 1985 | title = Children's responses to ambiguous messages and their understanding of ambiguity | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 21 | issue = 3| pages = 446–454 | doi=10.1037/0012-1649.21.3.446}}&lt;/ref&gt; Language plays an important role in children's accuracy in assessing their own knowledge. For children to accurately "know what they know" it is important for them to understand the various meanings of the word "know" as well as language used to describe certainty and uncertainty.&lt;ref name="mitchell1992" /&gt;&lt;ref name="moore1989"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moore | first1 = C.

===Children's processing of ignorant and ambiguous statements ===
[[Ambiguity|Ambiguous]] information is "a piece of information (word, message, or view) with multiple interpretations".&lt;ref name="beck2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beck | first1 = S. R. | last2 = Robinson | first2 = E. J. | last3 = Freeth | first3 = M. M. | year = 2008 | title = Children can resist making interpretations when uncertain? | url =http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/49/1/WRAP_Robinson_8573940-150708-Beck_and_Robinson_and_Freeth_2008.pdf | journal = Journal of Experimental Child Psychology | volume = 99 | issue = 4 | pages = 252–270 | doi=10.1016/j.jecp.2007.06.002| pmid = 17673251 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adults not only have the awareness to spot ambiguity, but they also have ways to deal with it. But young children cannot do the same. Typically, children cannot successfully deal with ambiguous statements until they are 6 or 7 years old. &lt;ref name="beck2001"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beck | first1 = S. R. | last2 = Robinson | first2 = E. J. | year = 2001 | title = Children's ability to make tentative interpretations of ambiguous messages | journal = Journal of Experimental Child Psychology | volume = 79 | issue = 1| pages = 95–114 | doi=10.1006/jecp.2000.2583| pmid = 11292313 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="singer1981"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Singer | first1 = J.

H. | year = 1981 | title = Development of knowledge about communication: Children's evaluation of explicitly ambiguous messages | journal = Child Development | volume = 52 | issue = 4| pages = 1211–1215 | doi=10.2307/1129508| jstor = 1129508 | pmid = 7318521 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it seems in certain contexts with certain tasks, younger children also can somewhat deal with unclear or ambiguous statements. &lt;ref name="mitchell1992"&gt;Mitchell, P . &amp; Robinson, E. J. (1992). Children's understanding of the evidential connotation of 'know' in relation to overestimation of their own knowledge, Journal of Child Language, 19, 167-182.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The role of language and prior experience===
Language can affect whether one can [[Word-sense disambiguation|correctly deal with ambiguous statements]]. One can "know" someone in many different ways, for example, seeing them, talking to them, having a prior history with them, having a relationship with them, etc. This makes questions like "Do you know?" very complex and hard to answer. Clearer definitions of "to know" seem to help children to check their own knowledge better. Children as young as 4 years old could make far more accurate statements about their actual knowledge when a question was phrased "Have you ''heard of''" rather than "Do you ''know''".&lt;ref name="robinson1994"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robinson | first1 = E. J. | last2 = Mitchell | first2 = P. | year = 1994 | title = Children's judgements of ignorance on the basis of absence of experience | journal = British Journal of Developmental Psychology | volume = 12 | issue = 2| pages = 113–129 | doi=10.1111/j.2044-835x.1994.tb00623.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the age of 6, children typically could accurately check their knowledge with very little impact on their future answers regardless of the language used. 4- and 5-year-olds, on the other hand, were so changeable that the phrase used affected their future answers. 4- and 5-year-olds were also less likely to overestimate their knowledge of a target person if the starting question was phrased "Have you ''heard of''" rather than "Do you ''know''".&lt;ref name="robinson1994" /&gt; Not only can responses from children be altered by the question’s phrasing, but they can also change their response when the question suggests they are not familiar with the person. In a study where children were asked if they really knew who a specific person was (between 2 pictures of people they had never seen before), they were more accurate in assessing that they ''didn't know'' when it was suggested that the target person had never been to their before.&lt;ref name="robinson1994" /&gt; While experience is important, children tend not to over-rely on prior experiences and only use it when they've had enough experience that can help assess their knowledge.&lt;ref name= "robinson1994" /&gt;

===Partial information===
Sometimes when confronted with ambiguous information, more than one piece of information is required to make and accurate interpretation. For example, in a study where children had to pick one of four pictures presented to them after hearing ambiguous information, they were capable of making tentative interpretations and then correctly changing their interpretations upon hearing contradicting, clarifying information.&lt;ref name="beck2001" /&gt; This strategy uses multiple pieces of information and has been seen in children as young as 15 months old.&lt;ref name="ganea2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ganea | first1 = P. A. | last2 = Saylor | first2 = M. M. | year = 2007 | title = Infants' use of shared linguistic information to clarify ambiguous requests | journal = Child Development | volume = 78 | issue = 2| pages = 493–502 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2007.01011.x | pmid=17381786}}&lt;/ref&gt; In situations where only partial information is available, young children make the best interpretation possible with the information given and go on to change this interpretation only when contradicting information emerges.&lt;ref name="robinson1982" /&gt;

===Delaying interpretation===
Clarifying (disambiguating) information is not always instantly available. In these situations, adults seem to delay interpretation and seek clarifying information when appropriate. Children find it harder to understand what actions they need to take to clarify than to identify an ambiguous situation that pops up. There are 2 different types of delay in interpreting ambiguous information: one that is [[intention]]al and one that is [[instinct]]ual.&lt;ref name="beck2008" /&gt; The decision to delay interpretation and seek further information is a difficult one as it involves being aware that the information given at that point are not sufficient and knowing how to ask for the ones necessary for clarification. Children are typically failures in this process until the age of 7.&lt;ref name="beck2001" /&gt; However, when this explicit decision to delay is simplified, children aged 5 and up showed some ability in successfully choosing to delay their response.&lt;ref name="beck2008" /&gt; While the ability to intentionally delay interpretation seems to be difficult, the ability to delay interpretation instinctively seems to be easier for young children. In one example, children were asked to stamp the correct snowman once they knew which one it was.&lt;ref name="beck2008" /&gt; Their knowledge of the correct snowman was based on a researcher slowly revealing the target snowman. The children's cards contained snowmen that differed by some feature visible on the 2nd half of the snowman only and therefore the children were required to wait until the 2nd half of the snowman was revealed in order to accurately assess which snowman was the correct one. In this scenario focusing on instinct, children as young as 5 were able to accurately delay interpretation.&lt;ref name="beck2008" /&gt; Therefore, while it is difficult for children to explicitly demonstrate their awareness of an ambiguous situation and how to resolve it, they are implicitly able to handle situations in which delaying interpretation may be beneficial.

===Referents and meaning===
It is difficult for younger children to grasp the idea that objects can be referred to in different ways and that people can have partial knowledge of the different references (i.e. a "bouncy ball" might also be referred to as a "rubber sphere"). A child might know by looking that a toy is a toy truck, but they may not be aware that the toy truck is also a present. [[Opaque context|Referential opacity]] is the concept of whether or not referring to an object changes its meaning. If something is referentially ''transparent'' (substitution insensitive), altering the [[referent]] term does not alter the meaning, and something that is referentially ''opaque'' (substitution sensitive) means that altering the referent term would alter the meaning. An example of this is a study with a puppet named Heinz.&lt;ref name="robinson2001"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robinson | first1 = E. J. | last2 = Apperly | first2 = I. A. | year = 2001 | title = Children's difficulties with partial representations in ambiguous messages and referentially opaque contexts | journal = Cognitive Development | volume = 16 | pages = 595–615 | doi=10.1016/s0885-2014(00)00035-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a ball in a box and children are told that Heinz knows that there is a ball in the box but does not know that the ball is a present. Children are then asked substitution-insensitive questions (i.e. Does Heinz know the ball is a present? – asking, "Does Heinz know the rubber sphere is a present?" ''does not'' alter the meaning of the question) and substitution sensitive questions (i.e. Does Heinz know there's a present in the box? – asking "Does Heinz know there is a rubber sphere in the box" ''does'' alter the meaning of the question). Regardless of age, substitution-''insensitive'' questions seem to be easier than substitution-''sensitive'' questions. The ability to correctly answer substitution-sensitive questions improves with age.&lt;ref name="robinson2001" /&gt; The ability to answer these types of questions is closely related to effectively evaluating ambiguous messages. Success on substitution-insensitive questions is necessary but not sufficient for success on evaluation ambiguous messages. Alternatively, success on substitution-sensitive questions is necessary and sufficient for success at evaluating ambiguous messages.&lt;ref name="robinson2001" /&gt;

=== Physical and epistemic uncertainty ===
Children can change their interpretation of information based on the context in which the interpretation is made.&lt;ref name="robinson2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robinson | first1 = E. J. | last2 = Rowley | first2 = M. G. | last3 = Beck | first3 = S. R. | last4 = Carroll | first4 = D. J. | last5 = Apperly | first5 = I.

Physical uncertainty occurs when an event has not yet happened, and therefore the outcome of that event has not been determined (i.e. the dice has not yet been rolled). Epistemic uncertainty occurs when an event has already occurred, but the child is not aware of the outcome of the event (i.e. the dice have been rolled, but the dice are hidden from the participant). 4- to 8-year old children have the ability to realize multiple possibilities for an event that has not yet occurred (''physical uncertainty''), however they do not seem to acknowledge that there are exactly the same possibilities for an event that has already happened when they don't know the outcome (''epistemic uncertainty''). Under the conditions of ''epistemic uncertainty'', children simply guess one of the possibilities. Beck and colleagues (2011) propose that this happens because it is much easier to imagine the outcome during epistemic uncertainty, basically knowing that there is only one outcome.&lt;ref name="beck2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beck | last2 = McColgan | first2 = K.

=== Feeling-of-knowing (FOK) ===
Feeling-of-knowing occurs when people are unable to easily recall a memory or a fact, but they know that they learned it and are able to recognize it, such as in a multiple-choice test.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, T.O., &amp; Narens, L. (1994). Why investigate metacognition? In J. Metcalife &amp;A.P. Shimamura (Eds.), Metacognition. Knowing about knowing (pp. 1–25). Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Adults' accuracy of feeling-of-knowing judgments is well above chance but not nearly perfect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Koriat | first1 = A | year = 1993 | title = How do we know that we know? The accessibility model of the feeling of knowing | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 100 | issue = 4| pages = 609–639 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.100.4.609| pmid = 8255951 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It seems to be the same for children as well. Lockl and Schneider (2002) did not find any developmental trends in the accuracy of feeling-of-knowing judgments. Instead, similar to adults, children's accuracy of feeling-of knowing judgments was low, but still above chance for all age groups studied (grade 1 through grade 4).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lockl | first1 = K. | last2 = Schneider | first2 = W. | year = 2002 | title = Developmental trends in children's feeling-of-knowing judgments | journal = International Journal of Behavioral Development | volume = 26 | issue = 4| pages = 327–333 | doi=10.1080/01650250143000210| s2cid = 143958809 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Getting a child to attend to this feeling-of-knowing (through language or prompting of prior experience) is one way to assist them in more accurately assessing their actual knowledge, allowing them to handle ambiguous situations at a much younger age.&lt;ref name="robinson1994" /&gt;

==Forensic applications==
Children are highly susceptible to a "[[suggestibility]] effect", producing "[[false memory|false memories]]" and/or "incorrect, post-event information" (see [[misinformation effect]]) when asked to engage in memory recall.&lt;ref name="welch-ross1997"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Welch-Ross | first1 = M.

A. | year = 1997 | title = Young children's understanding of conflicting mental representation predicts suggestibility | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 33 | issue = 1 | pages = 43–53 | doi=10.1037/0012-1649.33.1.43| pmid = 9050389 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has important implications for forensic interviewing and child witness testimony.&lt;ref name="goodman2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goodman | first1 = G.S. | last2 = Melinder | first2 = A. | year = 2007 | title = Child witness research and forensic interviews of young children: A review | journal = Legal and Criminological Psychology | volume = 12 | pages = 1–19 | doi=10.1348/135532506x156620}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consider the prominent case of Kelly Michael's (see [[Wee Care Nursery School abuse trial]]), where improper interviewing techniques lead to a miscarriage of justice. In order to develop reliable and age-appropriate instruments for interviewing children, it is imperative to consider their cognitive development, verbal and mental abilities.&lt;ref name="welch-ross1997" /&gt;&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt;

===Forensic interviews and techniques===
====Factors that can impact disclosure====
It is critical for a forensic interviewer to recognize their power during an interview, especially with a child witness. An interviewer can impact the course of a child's testimony in numerous ways, including:
* Eliciting "false allegations" through leading and suggestive questions&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;
* Determining the amount of detail a child may disclose&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;
* Prevent a child from disclosing&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;
* Interviewer's gender may also impact the quality and details of disclosure. Children between the ages of 4 and 6 are more likely to disclose to an interviewer of the same gender.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;

The age of a child is also an important factor during interviewing. Younger children are more likely to provide shorter, less detailed accounts of an event in comparison to older children.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt; Preschool children are more likely to disclose information in an "accidental way" through triggers and obvious cues, whereas older school children are more likely to make "intentional disclosures" based on the nature of the question they are asked.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;

====Improper interviewing====
There are varying techniques and extraneous factors that can influence the way a child discloses an event during child witness testimony (e.g., experiences of abuse by a parent or caregiver). There are two major types of barriers in forensic interviews: (1) improper interviewing and (2) clumsy interviewing&lt;ref name="wood2000"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wood | first1 = J. | last2 = Garven | first2 = S. | year = 2000 | title = How sexual abuse interviews go astray: Implications for prosecutors, police and child protection services | journal = Child Maltreatment | volume = 5 | issue = 2| pages = 109–118 | doi=10.1177/1077559500005002003| pmid = 11232084 | s2cid = 26722045 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cronch2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cronch | first1 = L. E. | last2 = Viljoen | first2 = J. L. | last3 = Hansen | first3 = D. J. | year = 2006 | title = Forensic interviewing in child sexual abuse cases: Current techniques and future directions | url = https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/psychfacpub/6| journal = Aggression and Violent Behavior | volume = 11 | issue = 3| pages = 195–207 | doi=10.1016/j.avb.2005.07.009| s2cid = 34223151 | url-access = subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Improper interviewing'' includes forensic techniques that are considered to be "risky and ineffective".&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt; Each of the following techniques can create critically negative consequences in witness testimony and result in false allegations or the potential for a reduced conviction:&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;
# Use of reinforcement: If an interviewer utilizes rewards and punishments to coerce disclosure&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;
# Social influence: If an interviewer informs a child of another child's disclosure or recollection&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;
# Asking suggestive or leading questions: This can occur when an interviewer provides a child with information that has not been previously known&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;
# Removing the child from direct experience: For example, asking a child "what ''might'' have happened"&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;

''Clumsy interviewing'' involves interviews that fail to include best practices and recommended techniques.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt; Interviewers who are not properly trained in forensic techniques can fail to follow structured interview guidelines and impact the outcome of a child's testimony and/or responses to questioning. This type of interviewing most often occurs when an interviewer lacks skill, forgets important procedures, and when there is a lack of necessary supervision.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;

In order to prevent improper forensic interviewing, numerous methods to reduce suggestibility and the misinformation effect have been proven effective, including: taping interviews, recording transcripts, ensuring supervision by a qualified professional, experience in working with children, training in forensic interviewing, and maintaining a comfortable, safe environment.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;

====Types of interviewing====
The '''''cognitive interview''''' utilizes cognitive theory as a focal point in its interview methodology. The cognitive interview, first developed in 1992 by researchers Fisher and Geiselman, was originally developed for adults and later modified for children. It utilizes two major perspectives from cognitive theory, including the "[[encoding specificity principle]]" and a "multi-component view of memory traces".&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt;

Specifically, this method utilizes four major techniques:&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt;
# Report everything: i.e., "''tell me everything you remember''"&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt;
# Context reinstatement: i.e., "''think back to where you were at the time''"&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt;
# Reverse order: i.e., "''now that you told me what happened, try to remember it again but this time starting at the end and recounting it in reverse chronological order''"&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt;
# Change perspective: i.e., "''what would the perpetrator have seen and heard?''"&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt;

'''''The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Protocol'''''
developed an investigative protocol in 2000 to create a structured interview technique for children, specifically those of child sexual abuse.&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lamb2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lamb | first1 = M. E. | last2 = Orbach | first2 = Y. | last3 = Hershkowitz | first3 = I. | last4 = Esplin | first4 = P. W. | last5 = Horowitz | first5 = D. | year = 2007 | title = A structured forensic interview protocol improves the quality and informativeness of investigative interviews with children: A review of research using the NICHD Investigative Protocol | journal = Child Abuse &amp; Neglect | volume = 31 | issue = 11–12| pages = 1201–1231 | doi=10.1016/j.chiabu.2007.03.021 | pmid=18023872 | pmc=2180422}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It uses the following techniques:&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lamb2007" /&gt;
# Introductory phase: This is necessary for [[rapport]] building&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt;
# Practice in free-recall: "''Tell me about your last birthday party''"&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt;
# Information about the ground rules: "''It's okay to say "I don't know"''"&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt;
# Open-ended questions: "''Tell me why you came to talk to me''"&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt;

'''''Stepwise interview'''''
utilizes open-ended questions through a "funnel-like strategy".&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt; It is primarily used by legal professionals, and is most often used in North America.&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt; This interview begins with open-ended questions and/or free recall and slowly incorporates more focused and detailed questions.&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt;

'''''Allegation blind interviews'''''
stress that an interviewer should refrain from gathering information prior to an interview in order to reduce suggestibility and increase interviewer patience and attentiveness.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt; This also enhances the interviewer's ability to be non-judgmental and objective.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;

'''''Truth-lie discussions'''''
are most useful prior to commencing abuse-related questioning. This method allows the interviewer to create a baseline with the child about what the "truth" is and what a "lie" is.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt; The interviewer is encouraged to ask questions with general examples, such as "tell me a lie about this chair".&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt; This strategy has been proven to result in a less misinformed child testimony.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;

'''''Touch survey'''''
was developed on the basis that "touch falls on a continuum", and is beneficial to screen for child abuse.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt; It includes questions surrounding the child's experiences with touch (e.g., kissing, hugging, hitting), including where they have been touched and by whom.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt; This tool might be more useful when used in conjunction with other forensic strategies.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;

===Recommendations for forensic interviewing===
Although there are varying suggestions for structured forensic interviewing, experts provide context into best practices that can significantly reduce suggestibility, false memories and the misinformation effect:&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;
# Interviews should be conducted in a safe, child-friendly environment.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;
# A child's age should be considered when being interviewed, and practices should be modified accordingly.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;
# Structured interview protocol should always be utilized.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;
# Interviewers should engage in professional training when possible.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;
# Ground rules are essential for the beginning of the interview so that the child is aware of the type of responses they can provide (e.g., "I don't know").&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;

[[File:Surveillance quevaal.jpg|thumb|Surveillance cameras track everyday movement in cities all across the world.]]
'''Pattern-of-life analysis''' is a method of [[surveillance]] that documents or understands the habits of a person or population. Motives may include [[Signals intelligence|security]], [[normal profit|profit]], scientific research, regular censuses, and [[traffic analysis]]. The data of interest may reflect anything in a person or persons' life: their travels, purchases, internet browsing habits, choices, and so forth. The data is used to predict a subject's future action or to detect anomalous behavior. 

== Notable examples ==

=== Esri's use of ArcGIS ===
[[Esri]] is an international supplier of [[Geographic Information System]] (GIS) software, web GIS and [[geodatabase]] management applications. Esri uses the name [[ArcGIS]] to refer to its suite of GIS software products, which operate on desktop, server, and mobile platforms. The term GIS describes any [[information]] system that integrates, stores, edits, analyzes, shares and displays geographic information for informing [[decision making]]. With this technology, the company's goal is to unify information of a subject's life habits and their geographical whereabouts with statistics related to [[Improvised explosive device|IED]] casualties in an effort to predict and prevent another IED incident from happening. In one presentation used at an Esri Federal User Conference, it states: "Exploitation of a cell's network enables a commander with the right tools to get 'Left of Boom' [i.e. before an IED or bomb detonates]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Using ArcGIS for intelligence analysis|url=http://proceedings.esri.com/library/userconf/feduc11/papers/tech/feduc-using-arcgis-for-intelligence-analysis.pdf|accessdate=11 April 2014|last1=Mason|first1=Tony|last2=Foss|first2=Suzanne|last3=Lam|first3=Vinh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== MARINA ===
[[MARINA]] is an NSA database and analysis toolset for intercepted Internet metadata (DNI in NSA terminology). The database stores metadata up to a year. According to documents leaked by Edward Snowden: "The Marina metadata application tracks a user's browser experience, gathers contact information/content and develops summaries of target" and "[o]f the more distinguishing features, Marina has the ability to look back on the last 365 days' worth of DNI metadata seen by the Sigint collection system, regardless whether or not it was tasked for collection." [Emphasis in original NSA document.] The stored metadata is mainly used for pattern-of-life analysis. US persons are not exempt because metadata is not considered data by US law (section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hu|first=Margaret|title=Taxonomy of the Snowden disclosures|journal=Wash. &amp; Lee L. Rev.}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{fact|date=July 2017}}

MARINA's phone counterpart is [[MAINWAY]].

=== Wide-Area Motion Imagery ===

[[Wide-Area Motion Imagery (WAMI)|Wide-area motion imagery (WAMI)]] generates high-resolution images to enable tracking and recording of vehicle and pedestrian movements over city-sized areas. Pattern of life (POL) or behavior pattern describes a recurrent (e.g., normalcy) way of acting by an individual or group toward a given object or in a given situation. Usually, one has a specific POL, and this POL is repeatable. Full motion video or WAMI data with extracted tracks can be used for POL analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://proceedings.spiedigitallibrary.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=1691331|title=Pattern of life from WAMI objects tracking based on context-aware tracking and information network models|last1=Gao|first1=J.|last2=Ling|first2=Haibin|accessdate=23 May 2013|last3=Blasch|first3=Erik|last4=Pham|first4=Khanh|last5=Wang|first5=Zhonghai|last6=Chen|first6=Genshe|date=23 May 2013 |volume=8745 |pages=528–536 |doi=10.1117/12.2015612 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spie.org/x94023.xml?highlight=x2410&amp;ArticleID=x94023|title=Context-aware tracking with wide-area motion imagery|last1=Gao|first1=J.|last2=Ling|first2=Haibin|accessdate=7 June 2013|last3=Blasch|first3=Erik}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Information Oriented Software Development is a [[software development methodology]] focused on working with [[information]] inside a computer program as opposed to working with just data. A significant difference exists between data and information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diffen.com/difference/Data_vs_Information] Data vs. Information&lt;/ref&gt; Information Oriented Software Development relies on data structures specifically designed to hold information, and relies on frameworks that support those data structures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?InformationOriented] Information Oriented&lt;/ref&gt; Information oriented software development focuses on the conceptual needs of users and customers rather than the data storage models and object models.

==Information data structures==
Information data structures are data structures specifically intended to support information inside a computer program. Two common ones are as follows:
* Data structures to support [[Fuzzy logic]].
* Data structures to support concept combinations and concept [[Permutations]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gzb4-EqD76cC&amp;dq=%22combinations+of+concepts%22&amp;pg=PR11] An Ontological and Epistemological Perspective of Fuzzy Set Theory&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://wordpress.com/post/thisstack.wordpress.com/1449] Endemes are an Information Structure&lt;/ref&gt;

{{technical|date=September 2018}}
'''Information quality''' ('''InfoQ''') is the potential of a [[data set]] to achieve a specific (scientific or practical) goal using a given [[Empirical research|empirical analysis method]].

== Definition ==
Formally, the definition is &lt;code&gt;InfoQ = U(X,f|g)&lt;/code&gt; where X is the data, f the analysis method, g the goal and U the utility function. InfoQ is different from [[data quality]] and [[Efficiency (statistics)|analysis quality]], but is dependent on these components and on the relationship between them. 
   	
InfoQ has been applied in a wide range of domains like healthcare, customer surveys, data science programs, advanced manufacturing and Bayesian network applications.

Kenett and [[Galit Shmueli|Shmueli]] (2014) proposed eight dimensions to help assess InfoQ and various methods for increasing InfoQ: Data resolution, [[Data structure]], Data integration, Temporal relevance, Chronology of data and goal, [[Generalization]], [[Operationalization]], Communication.

[[Causal inference]] is another related component of information engineering.

===Control theory===
{{Main article|Control theory}}
Control theory refers to the control of ([[continuous function|continuous]]) [[dynamical systems]], with the aim being to avoid delays, overshoots, or [[stability theory|instability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Control Systems Engineering|last=Nise|first=Norman|publisher=Wiley|year=2015|isbn=978-1118170519}}&lt;/ref&gt; Information engineers tend to focus more on control theory rather than the physical design of control systems and [[Electronic circuit|circuits]] (which tends to fall under electrical engineering).

Subfields of control theory include [[classical control theory|classical control]], [[optimal control]], and [[nonlinear control]].

===Signal processing===
{{Main article|Signal processing}}
Signal processing refers to the generation, analysis and use of [[signals]], which could take many forms such as [[image processing|image]], [[sound processing|sound]], electrical, or biological.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Understanding Digital Signal Processing|last=Lyons|first=Richard|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2010|isbn=978-0137027415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Information theory===
{{Main article|Information theory}}
Information theory studies the analysis, transmission, and storage of information. Major subfields of information theory include [[code|coding]] and [[data compression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Elements of Information Theory|last=Cover|first=Thomas|publisher=Wiley-Interscience|year=2006|isbn=978-0471241959}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural language processing===
{{Main article|Natural language processing}}
Natural language processing deals with getting computers to understand human (natural) languages at a high level. This usually means [[Text (literary theory)|text]], but also often includes [[speech processing]] and [[speech recognition|recognition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Speech and Language Processing|last=Jurafsky|first=Daniel|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2008|isbn=978-0131873216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bioinformatics===
{{Main article|Bioinformatics}}

Rothkopf, who was at that time, a member of the advisory committee's board of directors at the [[Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health]]'s [[Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security]] which provides policy recommendations to the [[United States government]] and the [[World Health Organization]],&lt;ref name="open_phil"&gt;{{cite web |date=13 January 2017 |title=Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security — Biosecurity, Global Health Security, and Global Catastrophic Risks |url=http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/global-catastrophic-risks/biosecurity/center-health-security-biosecurity-global-health-security-and-global-catastrophic |access-date=February 8, 2017 |publisher=[[Open Philanthropy Project]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; said that the infodemic was the second of two concurrent epidemics.&lt;ref name="WaPo_Rothkopf_20030511"/&gt; Rothkopf described how the "information epidemic" transformed SARS from a regional health crisis into a "debacle" that spread globally with both economic and social repercussions.&lt;ref name="Rothkopf_20030518"/&gt; He said this infodemic "was not the rapid spread of simple news via the media, nor is it simply the rumor mill on steroids. Rather, as with SARS, it is a complex phenomenon caused by the interaction of mainstream media, specialist media and internet sites, and 'informal' media, which is to say wireless phones, text messaging, pagers, faxes, and e-mail, all transmitting some combination of fact, rumor, interpretation, and propaganda."&lt;ref name="WaPo_Rothkopf_20030511"/&gt; Rothkopf citing the State Department, said that 2002 was the "year of the most heightened state of terrorism panic in our history" even though terrorism globally had decreased to its "lowest level since 1969".&lt;ref name="WaPo_Rothkopf_20030511"/&gt; His company, the Washington DC–based strategic intelligence and analysis firm Intellibridge, which he had founded in 1999, tracked the January 2003 Chinese reports on the outbreak. On 9 February 2003, Intellibridge provided their analysis to the U.S. defense community, and then posted the information on ProMED, a Federation of American Scientists Web site.&lt;ref name="WaPo_Rothkopf_20030511"/&gt;

The general public did not learn of the outbreak until 23 February 2003, when an elderly woman died of SARS in her home in [[Toronto]], Canada, from Hong Kong. Her son, who spread the disease in a Toronto hospital, also died.&lt;ref name="Low_20200224"&gt;{{cite book |last=Low |first=Donald |author-link=Donald Low |chapter=SARS: Lessons from Toronto |pages=63–71 |chapter-url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92467/ |title=Learning from SARS: Preparing for the Next Disease Outbreak: Workshop Summary |date=2004 |publisher=National Academies Press |isbn=978-0-309-09154-1 |doi=10.17226/10915 |pmid=22553895 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the first death in North America, the Western media began to cover the outbreak. Rothkopf said that if more had been done earlier to manage the disease as well as information about SARS, perhaps there might not have been a worldwide panic. The infodemic spread globally, far beyond the countries that had SARS victims and "set off a chain reaction of economic and social consequences".&lt;ref name="WaPo_Rothkopf_20030511"/&gt; It also made it harder for health organizations to control the SARS epidemic as panic spread online.&lt;ref name="Ricchiardi_200306"/&gt;

Use of the term ''infodemic'' increased rapidly during the COVID-19 pandemic. A study found that from 2010-2020 there were 61 articles mentioning the word ''infodemic'', while between 2020 and 2021 there were 14,301 published stories using the term.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The [[United Nations]] and the [[World Health Organization]] began using the term ''infodemic'' during the COVID-19 pandemic as early as 2 February 2020.&lt;ref name= "WHO_20200202"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=31 March 2020 |title=UN tackles 'infodemic' of misinformation |url=https://www.un.org/en/un-coronavirus-communications-team/un-tackling-%E2%80%98infodemic%E2%80%99-misinformation-and-cybercrime-covid-19 |website=[[United Nations]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The related term '''''disinfodemic''''' (referring to COVID-19 [[disinformation]] campaigns) has been used by [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Capaldo |first1=Giuliana Ziccardi |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JJv5DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA341 |title=The Global Community Yearbook of International Law and Jurisprudence 2019 |date=October 2020 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-19-751355-2 |page=341 |language=en |access-date=20 May 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time that the ''[[Journal of Medical Internet Research]]'' published their June 2020 issue featuring the WHO's framework for managing [[misinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic|the infodemic related to the COVID-19 pandemic]], the WHO and public health agencies had acknowledged infodemiology as an "emerging scientific field" that was of critical importance during a pandemic.&lt;ref name="Eysenbach_20200629"/&gt; By 2021, the WHO had published a number of resources clarifying the infodemic.&lt;ref name="WHO_INfodemic_20210226"&gt;{{cite web |date=26 February 2021 |title=Infodemic |url=https://www.who.int/health-topics/infodemic#tab=tab_1 |access-date=19 September 2022 |work=[[World Health Organization]] |quote=An infodemic is too much information including false or misleading information in digital and physical environments during a disease outbreak.

A [[Royal Society]] and [[British Academy]] joint report published in October 2020 said of infodemics that: "[[COVID-19 vaccine]] deployment faces an infodemic with misinformation often filling the knowledge void, characterised by: (1) distrust of science and selective use of expert authority, (2) distrust in pharmaceutical companies and government, (3) straightforward explanations, (4) use of emotion; and, (5) echo chambers," and to combat the ill and "inoculate the public" endorsed the Singaporean [[POFMA]] legislation, which criminalises misinformation.&lt;ref name="rsba"&gt;{{cite report |url=https://royalsociety.org/-/media/policy/projects/set-c/set-c-vaccine-deployment.pdf?la=en-GB&amp;hash=43073E5429C87FD2674201CA19280A8E |title=COVID-19 vaccine deployment: Behaviour, ethics, misinformation and policy strategies |last1=Royal Society |last2=The British Academy |date=21 October 2020 |publisher=[[Royal Society]] |author1-link=Royal Society |author2-link=The British Academy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sksav"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Knapton |first1=Sarah |date=10 November 2020 |title=Spreading anti-vaxx myths 'should be made a criminal offence' |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/11/10/spreading-anti-vaxx-myths-should-made-criminal-offence/ |work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Aspen Institute]] even started their misinformation project before the pandemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRX1GRSxk-M |title=INFODEMIC – Documentary Series Launch Event |date=29 April 2021 |type=Video |publisher=[[The Aspen Institute]] |access-date=30 April 2021 |via=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
In his 11 May 2003 article in the ''Post'', Rothkopf wrote that the information epidemic or "infodemic" was a "combination of "[a] few facts, mixed with fear, speculation, and rumor, amplified and relayed swiftly worldwide by modern information technologies."&lt;ref name="Rothkopf_20030518"/&gt;

On 2 February 2020, the World Health Organization defined ''infodemic'' as a "an over-abundance of information{{emdash}}some accurate and some not{{emdash}}that makes it hard for people to find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance when they need it."&lt;ref name= "WHO_20200202"/&gt; A 21 February 2021 WHO publication, said that "[a]n infodemic is too much information including false or misleading information in digital and physical environments during a disease outbreak."&lt;ref name="WHO_INfodemic_20210226"/&gt;

Eysenbach described ''infodemiology'' as the study of "the determinants and distribution of health information and misinformation".&lt;ref name="Eysenbach_20021215"/&gt;

==Research during COVID-19==
As COVID-19 swept across the globe, information about how to stay safe and how to identify symptoms became vital. However, especially in the first phases of the pandemic, the amount of false, not validated and partially true information on the media was huge. Even seemingly reliable government sources did not always follow best practices in disseminating data about COVID-19, with many potentially misleading maps published on official websites.&lt;ref name="Mooney_Juhász_202007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Adams1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Adams |first1=Aaron M. |last2=Chen |first2=Xiang |last3=Li |first3=Weidong |last4=Chuanrong |first4=Zhang |date=27 July 2023 |title=Normalizing the pandemic: exploring the cartographic issues in state government COVID-19 dashboards |journal=[[Journal of Maps]] |volume=19 |issue=5 |pages=1–9 |bibcode=2023JMaps..19Q...1A |doi=10.1080/17445647.2023.2235385 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Adams2025"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Adams |first1=Aaron M. |last2=Gallaher |first2=Adam |last3=Benitez Ou |first3=Ashley |last4=Chen |first4=Xiang |last5=Li |first5=Weidong |last6=Zhang |first6=Chuanrong |last7=Mrozinski |first7=Richard |last8=Ghosh |first8=Debarchana |title=Mapping COVID-19: Applying Ethical Strategies in Web Mapping Decisions |journal=Cartographic Perspectives |date=2025 |volume=105 |pages=67–75. |doi=10.14714/CP105.1971 |url=https://cartographicperspectives.org/index.php/journal/article/view/1971/2423 |access-date=12 April 2025|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; The inappropriate use of maps on these websites may have contributed to political polarization in response to COVID-19 epidemiological control measures.&lt;ref name="Engel2022"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Engel |first1=Claudia |last2=Rodden |first2=Jonathan |last3=Tabellini |first3=Marco |date=18 March 2022 |title=Policies to influence perceptions about COVID-19 risk: The case of maps |journal=[[Science Advances]] |volume=8 |issue=11 |pages=eabm5106 |bibcode=2022SciA....8M5106E |doi=10.1126/sciadv.abm5106 |pmc=8932671 |pmid=35302842}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a proliferation of systematic reviews of COVID-19-related evidence, not all of which was robustly conducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Abbott |first1=Rebecca |last2=Bethel |first2=Alison |last3=Rogers |first3=Morwenna |last4=Whear |first4=Rebecca |last5=Orr |first5=Noreen |last6=Shaw |first6=Liz |last7=Stein |first7=Ken |last8=Thompson Coon |first8=Jo |title=Characteristics, quality and volume of the first 5 months of the COVID-19 evidence synthesis infodemic: a meta-research study |journal=BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine |date=3 June 2021 |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=bmjebm–2021–111710 |doi=10.1136/bmjebm-2021-111710|pmid=34083212 |pmc=9132873 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have pointed out a few primary challenges of communicating with the public about COVID-19. First, social media platforms that prioritize engagement over accuracy and allow fringe opinions to thrive without correction create an information ecology that is difficult to understand.&lt;ref name="Adams2025" /&gt; Second, as fast-moving science and politics intertwine during the pandemic, making decisions related to combatting misinformation becomes complicated by a volatile political environment and frequently changing scientific information.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Scheufele |first1=Dietram A. |last2=Krause |first2=Nicole M. |last3=Freiling |first3=Isabelle |date=December 2021 |title=Misinformed about the 'infodemic?'

==Combatting infodemics ==
Researchers have been seeking tools to combat infodemics. Gunther Eysenbach brings up four pillars of infodemic management: (1) information monitoring ([[infoveillance]]); (2) building [[Health literacy|eHealth literacy]] and [[science literacy]] capacity; (3) encouraging knowledge refinement and quality improvement processes such as [[fact-checking]] and [[Peer review|peer-review]]; and (4) accurate and timely [[knowledge translation]] which minimizes distorting factors such as political or commercial influences.&lt;ref name="Eysenbach_20200629"/&gt; Scholars also advocate for tech platforms to police their content more effectively, and empower individuals to make better decisions on their own to promote the emergence of truth. Social media companies may offer a variety of cues to help people make better judgments of whether a message is legitimate or not. For example, Facebook might, in addition to showing how many "likes" a post has received, allow the count of "dislikes" to offer a more symmetric view of opinions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Buchanan |first1=Mark |date=September 2020 |title=Managing the infodemic |journal=[[Nature Physics]] |volume=16 |issue=9 |pages=894 |bibcode=2020NatPh..16..894B |doi=10.1038/s41567-020-01039-5 |s2cid=225343682 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on information dissemination during the COVID-19 pandemic identified issues with standardization and presentation of related information on official U.S. government sources, specifically state and federal government COVID-19 dashboards.&lt;ref name="Mooney_Juhász_202007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Adams1" /&gt; When the most authoritative sources of information are not presenting the data accurately, bad conclusions are inevitable. The research suggested official sources for information take steps to ensure the way data are collected, analyzed, and presented is up to the highest standards and adheres to all conventions.&lt;ref name="Adams1" /&gt; Standards of web-maps for government agencies should be developed, widely published, and adhered to.&lt;ref name="Mooney_Juhász_202007" /&gt; The web-based maps and dashboards are, if properly employed, suggested as possible ways to combat infodemics in the future.&lt;ref name="Mooney_Juhász_202007" /&gt;

However, scholars emphasize that traditionally proposed ways to combat misinformation tend to rely on the assumption that if people encounter the correct information about an issue, they will make rational decisions based on the best scientific information available.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Research shows that this is often not the case and that people do not act in the best interest of scientific fact for reasons including "cognitive preferences for old habits, forgetfulness, small inconveniences in the moment, preferences for the path of least resistance, and motivated reasoning."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=National Academies of Sciences |first=Engineering |url=https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/25881/encouraging-adoption-of-protective-behaviors-to-mitigate-the-spread-of-covid-19 |title=Encouraging Adoption of Protective Behaviors to Mitigate the Spread of COVID-19: Strategies for Behavior Change |date=2020-07-23 |language=en |doi=10.17226/25881|isbn=978-0-309-68101-8 |s2cid=241252994 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, combatting misinformation should rely on a more nuanced analysis of both the content of the misinformation, as well as the socio-political environment in which it was disseminated.

==Criticism==
''[[Financial Times]]'' journalist Siddharth Venkataramakrishnan said in his 20 August 2021 article that casting the spread of misinformation and disinformation in terms of disease risks oversimplifying the problem and that "unlike the status of being healthy or infected by an actual disease, what constitutes accurate information is also subject to change." Venkataramakrishnan also pointed out that the focus of the infodemic has often been on "conspiracy theorists and snake-oil salesmen", largely ignoring the at times problematic actions and confusing messaging of governments and public health bodies throughout the pandemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Venkataramakrishnan |first=Siddharth |date=25 August 2020 |title=The real fake news about Covid-19 |url=https://www.ft.com/content/e5954181-220b-4de5-886c-ef02ee432260 |url-access=subscription |work=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Communication scholars Felix Simon and Chico Camargo at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] said in their 20 July 2021 ''New Media &amp; Society'' article that ''infodemic'' as metaphor "can be misleading, as it conflates multiple forms of social behaviour, oversimplifies a complex situation and helps constitute a phenomenon for which concrete evidence remains patchy." Pointing out that the infodemic as a concept is "journalistically powerful, intuitively satisfying, and in strong resonance with personal experiences and intuition", Simon and Camargo argue that empirical evidence for many of the claims surrounding the term is lacking. Instead of a genuine phenomenon they see the infodemic as "a territorial claim for those who want to apply their skills, a signal to others that they are working in this area, or a framing device to tie one's work to larger debates".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Simon |first1=Felix M |last2=Camargo |first2=Chico Q |date=20 July 2021 |title=Autopsy of a metaphor: The origins, use and blind spots of the 'infodemic' |journal=[[New Media &amp; Society]] |volume=25 |issue=8 |pages=2219–2240 |doi=10.1177/14614448211031908 |s2cid=237692119 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along the same lines, Krause, Freiling, and Scheufele warn of difficulties related to creating "an infodemic about the infodemic" and that research surrounding the term warrants clarification and acknowledgment of uncertainties related to its novelty and impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Krause |first1=Nicole M. |last2=Freiling |first2=Isabelle |last3=Scheufele |first3=Dietram A. |date=22 May 2022 |title=The 'Infodemic' Infodemic: Toward a More Nuanced Understanding of Truth-Claims and the Need for (Not) Combatting Misinformation |url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00027162221086263 |journal=[[The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science]] |volume=700 |issue=1 |doi=10.1177/0002716222108626 |doi-broken-date=1 November 2024 |s2cid=246965663 |access-date=21 March 2024 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is defined as the ratio of the number of [[Instance (computer science)|instances]]/[[Record (computer science)|records]] in the system (mostly implemented as a [[Database]]) that represent real world [[Entity class|entities]]  and the number of entities that exist (in the real world) and should be represented in the information system according to its [[Intention|purpose]].

Example: If there are 170 countries in the world and an information system holds 153 country records then the coverage of countries of this information system is 90%.

An '''information hazard''', '''infohazard''', or '''cognitohazard''' is "a risk that arises from the dissemination of (true) [[information]] that may cause harm or enable some agent to cause harm".&lt;ref name="Bostrom Hazards 2011" /&gt; It was formalized by philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]] in 2011. It challenges the principle of [[freedom of information]], as it states that some types of information are too dangerous, as people could either be harmed by it or use it to harm others.&lt;ref name="Bostrom Hazards 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wortmann |first=Fletcher |date=28 August 2019 |title=Infohazard Warning: How Internal Memes Infect Your Brain |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/triggered/201908/infohazard-warning-how-internal-memes-infect-your-brain |access-date=14 May 2021 |website=[[Psychology Today]] |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is sometimes why information is [[Classified information|classified]] based on its [[Information sensitivity|sensitivity]].

One example would be the instructions for creating a [[thermonuclear weapon]].&lt;ref name="Bostrom Hazards 2011" /&gt; Following these instructions could cause massive amounts of harm to others, therefore limiting who has access to this information is important in preventing harm to others.

== Classification ==
According to Bostrom, there are two defined major categories of information hazard. The first is the "adversarial hazard"&lt;ref name="Bostrom Hazards 2011" /&gt; which is where some information can be purposefully used by a bad actor to hurt others. The other category is where the harm is not purposeful, but merely an unintended consequence that harms the person who learns about it.&lt;ref name="Bostrom Hazards 2011" /&gt;

Bostrom also proposes several subsets of these major categories, including the following types:&lt;ref name="Bostrom Hazards 2011" /&gt;

* '''Data hazards''': A piece of data that can be used to harm others, such as the [[Nucleic acid sequence|DNA sequence]] of a lethal [[pathogen]].&lt;ref name="Bostrom Hazards 2011" /&gt;
* '''Idea hazards''': General ideas that can harm others if fulfilled. One example is the idea of "using a [[Nuclear fission|fission reaction]] to create a bomb". Knowing this idea alone can be enough for a well-resourced team to develop a nuclear bomb.&lt;ref name="Bostrom Hazards 2011" /&gt;{{Rp|page=3}}
* '''Knowing-too-much hazards''': Information that, if known, can cause danger to the person who knows it. For example, in the 1600s, women who allegedly possessed knowledge of the occult or birth control methods were at a higher risk of being accused of [[witchcraft]].&lt;ref name="Bostrom Hazards 2011" /&gt;{{Rp|page=9}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Levack|first=B.P|title=The Witch-Hunt in Early Modern Europe.|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage by context ==
=== Biotechnology ===
Additionally, the availability of information on DNA sequences of diseases or the chemical makeup of toxins could lead to adversarial hazards, as bad actors could use this information in order to recreate these biohazards on their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Lewis |first1=Gregory |last2=Millett |first2=Piers |last3=Sandberg |first3=Anders |last4=Snyder-Beattie |first4=Andrew |last5=Gronvall |first5=Gigi |date=May 2019 |title=Information Hazards in Biotechnology |journal=Risk Analysis |language=en |volume=39 |issue=5 |pages=975–981 |doi=10.1111/risa.13235 |pmid=30419157 |bibcode=2019RiskA..39..975L |issn=0272-4332 |doi-access=free |pmc=6519142}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, a research paper led to media coverage by explaining how to synthesize a [[poxvirus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Esvelt |first=Kevin M. |date=2018-10-04 |editor-last=Coyne |editor-first=Carolyn B. |title=Inoculating science against potential pandemics and information hazards |journal=PLOS Pathogens |language=en |volume=14 |issue=10 |pages=e1007286 |doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.1007286 |issn=1553-7374 |pmc=6171951 |pmid=30286188 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=19 January 2018 |title=A paper showing how to make a smallpox cousin just got published.

=== Information security ===
The concept of information hazards is also relevant to [[information security]]. Many government, public, and private entities have information that could be classified as a data hazard that could harm others if leaked. This could be the result of an adversarial hazard or an idea hazard. To avoid this, many organizations implement [[security controls]] depending on their own needs or the needs laid out by regulatory bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |url=https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final |title=Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations |last=Force |first=Joint Task |date=2020-12-10 |publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology |issue=NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53 Rev. 5 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Law ===
[[Willful blindness]] (also spelled wilful blindness) is the deliberate avoidance of knowledge of facts, in [[common law]] jurisdictions it is treated as equivalent to [[mens rea|actual knowledge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=The Principle of Wilful Blindness and Its Implications in The Malaysian and English Legal Systems – Legal Developments |url=https://www.legal500.com/developments/thought-leadership/the-principle-of-wilful-blindness-and-its-implications-in-the-malaysian-and-english-legal-systems/ |access-date=2025-06-07 |website=www.legal500.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is applied in criminal proceedings and [[corporate liability]] cases, particularly where individuals or entities deliberately restrict their access to information to avoid legal or ethical responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bovensiepen |first=Judith |last2=Pelkmans |first2=Mathijs |date=December 2020 |title=Dynamics of wilful blindness: an introduction |url=https://journals.sagepub.com/home/coa |journal=Critique of Anthropology |volume=40 |issue=4 |pages=387–402 |issn=0308-275X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, a company may deliberately try to avoid information on the safety of their work practices, as in the event of an injury their legal liability will be lessened if they were not officially aware of the danger.{{cn|date=June 2025}}

=== Literature ===
The idea of forbidden knowledge that can harm the person who knows it is found in many stories in the 16th and 17th centuries, which imply or explicitly state that some knowledge is dangerous for the viewer or for others and is better left hidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ginzburg |first=Carlo |date=1976 |title=High and Low: The Theme of Forbidden Knowledge in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries |url=https://academic.oup.com/past/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/past/73.1.28 |journal=Past and Present |language=en |issue=73 |pages=28–41 |doi=10.1093/past/73.1.28 |issn=0031-2746|url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Popular culture ===
The idea of an information hazard overlaps with the idea of a harmful trend or [[social contagion]]. In it, knowledge of certain trends can result in their replication, such as in the case of certain viral trends that can be physically dangerous to those who attempt them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Dangerous Social Media Challenges: Understanding Their Appeal to Kids |url=https://www.healthychildren.org/English/family-life/Media/Pages/Dangerous-Internet-Challenges.aspx |access-date=2023-11-14 |website=HealthyChildren.org |date=9 April 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Data ==
[[File:Data types - en.svg|thumb|Types of Data|291x291px]]
[[Data]] refers to digitized information that is compressed for efficient transmission.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Vaughan |first=Jack |date=July 2019 |title=data |url=https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatamanagement/definition/data |website=TechTarget}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data is constituted of binary values, expressed as 1 or 0, which allows complex thoughts, images, videos and more to be abstracted.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The level of data production and exchange has exploded in recent decades, with government and public agencies freely publishing vast swaths of data, particularly in environmental, cultural, scientific and statistical fields.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It has also led to a highly profitable industry for companies that collect, categorize and disseminate data as a tradable resource and operate within the newly defined data ecosystems.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;   

== Data ecosystems ==
The nature of an [[ecosystem]] denotes a symbiotic relationship between elements. Thus, when describing a data environment as an ecosystem, it describes a co-constitutive relationship. Their primary purpose is to create, manage and sustain the sharing of data across platforms and disciplines.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Key to this initiative are data intermediaries, which facilitate access to the data, and are categorized into seven types, including data trusts, [[data exchange]]s and [[Data management platform|data platform]]s.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Massey |first=Joe |date=August 18, 2022 |title=Data Institutions |url=https://theodi.org/article/what-are-data-intermediaries/#:~:text=What%20is%20a%20data%20intermediary%3F,' |access-date=November 20, 2022 |website=Open Data Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; A data ecosystem also comprises data providers and consumers, who as their titles denote, provide and consume the data through the intermediaries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  
 
A common example of data ecosystem exists within the realm of web browser. A third-party tracking app on a website (referred to as [[HTTP cookie|cookies]]) acts as an intermediary by collecting and organizing data. The web browser becomes the data provider, as it shares a user's information as they navigate through different websites. The websites themselves become consumers as they utilize the tracking information to tailor content based on user behaviour.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Freedman |first=Max |date=November 21, 2022 |title=Businesses Are Collecting Data. How Are They Using It? |url=https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/10625-businesses-collecting-data.html |access-date=2022-11-29 |website=Business News Daily |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
As mentioned, data ecosystems can span multiple sectors, for example, a client's medical data is shared with an insurance company to calculate a premium. The point of an ecosystem is that all actors within the shared environment are contributing to a common resource or knowledge-base.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  

=== Mapping ===
Data ecosystems possess three major characteristics: network, platform, and co-evolution.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Network loosely refers to the groups of data and technology developers, providers, and resellers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The platform, then, is the service, tool or platform that is collaboratively used by the network of actors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The platform provides the interface for the actors to produce their shared product or service.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The final characteristic refers to how the different actors and platform enable one another to evolve or improve upon itself.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The metaphorical use of the term "ecosystem" intrinsically demands that all parties involved are mutually benefited by their engagement. That would be the betterment or evolution of their own functioning, which leads to positive outcomes for the larger ecosystem. Again, to use the example of a web browser – the third-party tracking app collects data to help websites evolve their content strategies, which then provide more accurate user data to third-party trackers in an endless feedback loop.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Data assemblages ===
[[File:Data Assemblage.png|thumb|536x536px|A chart demonstrating the elements of a data assemblage &lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kitchin |first=Rob |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1285687714 |title=The data revolution : a critical analysis of big data, open data &amp; data infrastructures |date=2022 |isbn=978-1-5297-3375-4 |edition=2nd |location=Los Angeles, CA |oclc=1285687714}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Within the broad landscape of a data ecosystem are numerous data assemblages. An assemblage is described as interconnected socio-technical systems that work in tandem with one another for a common purpose.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These systems encompass the technological, political, financial and best practices that sustain the collection, transfer, and dispersion of data.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book |last=P. |first=Kitchin, Rob Lauriault, Tracey |url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1291151213 |title=Towards critical data studies: Charting and unpacking data assemblages and their work. The Programmable City Working Paper 2 |date=2014-07-27 |publisher=Programmable City |oclc=1291151213}}&lt;/ref&gt; The below table demonstrates the common elements of a data assemblage which facilitate and govern [[datafication]].

A data ecosystem contains numerous data assemblages, as each actor within the system have their own sets of tangible and non-tangible elements for their operation. Web browsers as data providers have their own assemblages of hardware, software, servers, finances, infrastructure, practices, etc. Each website that consumes the data and the broader companies that they represent similarly present an assemblage of systems. And the intermediary tracking sites which collect and sell the data operate within their own assemblage. It is possible that different assemblages may share elements within the broader ecosystem, or have individual elements, such as opposing hardware or platforms, that come into conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Cui |first1=Yesheng |last2=Kara |first2=Sami |last3=Chan |first3=Ka C. |date=April 2020 |title=Manufacturing big data ecosystem: A systematic literature review |journal=[[Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing]] |volume=62 |pages=101861 |doi=10.1016/j.rcim.2019.101861 |s2cid=208832261 |issn=0736-5845|url=http://eprints.usq.edu.au/37173/2/Manufacturing%20big%20data%20ecosystem%20A%20Systematic%20literature%20review_2ndresubmit_v2.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a web browser may include ad blockers which conflict with the third-party trackers that attempt to scrape a user's data. 

=== Big data ===
{{main|Big data}}
The rise of data ecosystems is part and parcel with the development of big data. Big data is an emerging trend in science and technology that tracks and defines almost all human engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Demchenko |first1=Yuri |last2=de Laat |first2=Cees |last3=Membrey |first3=Peter |title=2014 International Conference on Collaboration Technologies and Systems (CTS) |chapter=Defining architecture components of the Big Data Ecosystem |date=May 2014 |chapter-url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6867550 |location=Minneapolis, MN, USA |publisher=IEEE |pages=104–112 |doi=10.1109/CTS.2014.6867550 |isbn=978-1-4799-5158-1|s2cid=2920274 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is defined by the following five properties: 

==== Volume ====
Big data consists of massive amounts of information, which could be [[terabytes]] or [[petabytes]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==== Velocity ====
Big data is produced rapidly, and exchanged in real-time.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==== Variety ====
Big Data are extremely diverse, constituting numerous fields of study, and with extensive practical applications.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==== Value ====
Big data has inherent value due to the potential application of the data and the political economy in which it operates.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Gillis |first=Alexander |date=March 2021 |title=5 V's of big data |url=https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatamanagement/definition/5-Vs-of-big-data |website=TechTarget}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Veracity ====
Big data must be considered accurate and of high-quality. This can be difficult, as information may be incomplete or wrong, but there should be a level of trust that the collection of the data was done with the intention of being truthful.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Concerns ==

The main concern or critique of data ecosystems relates to privacy. Who has access to the data, either implicitly or explicitly? How is that data secured? How is it being used, and perhaps monetized? The non-profit organization Cloud Secure Alliance (CSA) categorizes the security challenges of Big Data Ecosystems into four groups; infrastructure security, data privacy, data management, and integrity and relative security.{{Citation needed|date=February 2023}}

In the case of a web browser, website and third-party tracking operation, there is a clear financial incentive for why data is collected and how it is used. But there is also a level of surveillance that occurs in this scenario, that perhaps goes unnoticed. Rob Kitchin terms this as 'dataveillance,' a result of the datafication of everyday life which allows for highly accurate and continuous tracking of our locations and activities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Who else, besides those trackers and websites, has access to the data being collected, and is it used for more nefarious purposes? In the case of US states that have banned access to abortions, there's concern that these data ecosystems can be harnessed to penalize citizens that seek services out of state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Ng |first=Alfred |date=July 18, 2022 |title='A uniquely dangerous tool': How Google's data can help states track abortions |url=https://www.politico.com/news/2022/07/18/google-data-states-track-abortions-00045906 |website=Politico}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Yorigami Maritime Construction SHINSHO-1600.JPG|thumb|Barge outfitted with Cranes is towed into position.]]
'''Marine construction''' is the process of building structures in or adjacent to large bodies of water, usually the sea. These structures can be built for a variety of purposes, including transportation, energy production, and recreation. Marine construction can involve the use of a variety of building materials, predominantly steel and [[concrete]]. Some examples of marine structures include ships, offshore platforms, moorings, pipelines, cables, wharves, bridges, tunnels, breakwaters and docks. Marine construction may require diving work, but [[professional diving]] is expensive and dangerous, and may involve relatively high risk, and the types of tools and equipment that can both function underwater and be safely used by divers are limited. [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle]]s (ROVs) and other types of submersible equipment are a lower risk alternative, but they are also expensive and limited in applications, so when reasonably practicable, most underwater construction involves either removing the water from the building site by [[dewatering]] behind a [[cofferdam]] or inside a [[Caisson (engineering)|caisson]], or [[prefabrication]] of structural units off-site with mainly assembly and installation done on-site.{{Citation needed|date=February 2024}}

==Environmental influences==
Some aspects of the marine environment that complicate construction:
* Distance from permanent facilities causes logistical problems for provision of materials, equipment, power supplies, and accommodation.&lt;ref name="Gerwick 2007" /&gt;{{rp|Ch 1.2}}
* [[Hydrostatic pressure]] due to depth in the water column. Hydrostatic pressure is linear with depth and increases at approximately 1 bar for every ten metres of depth.&lt;ref name="Gerwick 2007" /&gt;{{rp|Ch 1.3}}
* [[Temperature]] of the water and the air above it. [[Sea surface temperature]] can vary from a minimum of {{convert|-2|°C|°F}} to a maximum of about {{convert|32|C|F}}. Higher surface temperatures decrease rapidly with depth, and generally reach a steady-state of about {{convert|2|C|F}} by about {{convert|1000|m|ft}}, though on Australia's Northwest Shelf, water and seabed temperature may exceed {{convert|30|C|F}} at a depth of {{convert|250|m|ft}}. Air temperatures may vary much more, and though the water has a moderating effect, the air temperature more variable and may be much more extreme.&lt;ref name="Gerwick 2007" /&gt;{{rp|Ch 1.4}}
* [[Seawater]] and [[splash zone]] chemistry&lt;ref name="Gerwick 2007" /&gt;{{rp|Ch 1.5}}
* [[Biofouling]]&lt;ref name="Gerwick 2007" /&gt;{{rp|Ch 1.5}}
* [[Current (fluid)|Currents]] cause drag loading on structures and equipment. There are several different types of currents in the seas. Categorised by their cause, these include geostrophic, tidal, wind-driven, oceanic circulation and density, as well as those caused by river discharge. River currents are driven mainly by gravity, but differ laterally and vertically. The highest velocity in river currents is usually near the outer bank in a bend, and hey also locally increase around obstructions to their flow. Current may also spin off eddies, and their lateral boundaries may vary considerably over the short term. There may also be short or long term vertical components in some areas, the [[upwelling]]s and [[downwelling]]s often associated with bottom topography and winds in coastal areas. Currents may be stratified vertically, even to the extent that they may flow in opposing directions at the surface and at the bottom. Their influence on underwater construction is a consequence of the drag forces induced and the transport of unconsolidated sediment, particularly by [[hydrodynamic scour|scour]], both during and after construction. Water passing over an immersed surface can also cause lift forces, proportional to the square of the velocity, which can complicate operations, so the variations of instantaneous velocity induced by waves can further complicate matters.&lt;ref name="Gerwick 2007" /&gt;{{rp|Ch 1.6}}
* [[Gravity wave|Waves]] are a further environmental influence near the surface, which cause perturbations in all six degrees of freedom on a floating object, and can exert large forces on a fixed object. They are a major cause of delays and reduced operating efficiency, and may be the major design criterion for fixed structures. [[Tsunami]]s are a class of wave which occur relatively seldom but can have a devastating effect due to the large amounts of energy they can carry over long distances at high speeds. The depth to which a wave has significant motion is a function of [[wave length]], and to a lesser extent, on [[wave height]].&lt;ref name="Gerwick 2007" /&gt;{{rp|Ch 1.7}}
*[[Wind]]
*[[Tide]]s and [[storm surge]]s
*Rain, snow and fog reduce visibility, but with radar and precision positioning systems they are not as serious a hazard as in the past. Nevertheless, they may cause delays in some operations. In heavy rainfall appreciable quantities of water may enter unprotected openings, and must be removed before it has adverse effects on stability due to free-surface. Fog may be of the summer fog type which forms some distance above the water and may leave a narrow band of clear air just above the water, or winter type, where there mat be dense fog just above the water but clear skies a short distance up. Rain, fog and snow may prevent helicopter operations, which generally require good visibility for landing. Snow may present the additional problem of removal to prevent accumulation. Spray caused by wind and waves can also dump large amounts of water which must be drained, and in colder conditions may freeze and build up a burden of ice. Severe spray may prevent people from working on deck. Atmospheric icing, also known as black ice can occur in sub-Arctic regions, when the air is humid and the temperature is low. Ice forms directly on cold surfaces and can accumulate rapidly, adding topside weight and increasing wind drag. Icing and frozen spray may occur in the same regions and in similar conditions. Lightning is generally not a major problem to steel and concrete structure with adequate lightning protection, but is a hazard to personnel working in high exposed areas.&lt;ref name="Gerwick 2007" /&gt;{{rp|Ch 1.10}}

==Geotechnical aspects==

The geology of the seabed has a strong influence on almost any marine structure. The seabed is the substrate on which the structure must stand, and both the morphology and the material affect the design and construction. It is therefore necessary for accurate and reliable geological surveys to be made before a construction project can be started. There have been developments in sampling of seabeds but some soils remain difficult to analyse and sampling may not produce results as accurate as would be desired. In-place strength may be greater than conventional sampling methods indicate, and sampling methods may not recover and identify critical constituents due to insufficient sampling. Failure to identify potential problems can lead to delays and cost overruns. Many marine structures cover extensive areas, and the soil properties may vary considerably. Cost and time constraints may make it difficult to gather sufficient samples from borings to fully describe the substrate. Other methods for remote substrate analysis may identify potential variations for closer examination.&lt;ref name="Gerwick 2007" /&gt;{{rp|Ch 2.1}}

Bottom material is often sedimentary, and in deeper water, may range from extremely fine, low density silts to loose gravels, to dense, highly compacted sands. Granular sediments may be subject to liquefaction if strongly disturbed, as by earthquakes, cyclic impact of storm waves, or crushing by sea ice.&lt;ref name="Gerwick 2007" /&gt;{{rp|Ch 2.2}} When this occurs the soil can behave like a dense liquid. This can also happen during some construction processes, such as piledriving.&lt;ref name="Gerwick 2007" /&gt;{{rp|Ch 2.3}} The presence of large boulders in glacial till deposits can give a misleading impression of bedrock, hiding the further extent of softer sediment below.&lt;ref name="Gerwick 2007" /&gt;{{rp|Ch 2.5}}

In arctic regions, permafrost can form an unreliable foundation, and deeply buried clathrates can be a problem when drilling, but are usually too deep to be a problem for construction.&lt;ref name="Gerwick 2007" /&gt;{{rp|Ch 2.7}}

Methane can occur at shallow depths in delta sediments with significant quantities of organic matter, and in arctic silts. These van reduce the shear strength of silty and clay soils. A sudden, large release may temporarily reduce water density sufficiently to cause vessels or drill rigs to sink, and can cause an explosion or fire at the surface.&lt;ref name="Gerwick 2007" /&gt;{{rp|Ch 2.10}}

Clays may initially support a steep slope when excavated, but are subject to creep and sudden large-scale collapse when subjected to shock loads or vibration.&lt;ref name="Gerwick 2007" /&gt;{{rp|Ch 2.11}}

Unconsolidated sand – seasonal shifts.&lt;ref name="Gerwick 2007" /&gt;{{rp|Ch 2.13}}

Underwater sand dunes can form where there are strong currents, which may move with the currents, as sand is lifted by flow over the back of the dune, and dropped at the front. This can be a problem when laying pipelines, and may require deeper than usual burial.&lt;ref name="Gerwick 2007" /&gt;{{rp|Ch 2.14}}

==Materials and fabrication==

Marine construction materials subjected to coarse conditions including corrosion and temperature change. Fabrication can also be complicated by the large scale of some structures, and the need to transport them to the site for modular installation, and possible thermal differences between components and the fabrication and installation sites. The most commonly used materials in marine construction are concrete and steel.&lt;ref name="Stannard 2021" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gerwick 2007" /&gt;{{rp|Ch 4}}

===Steel=== 
Durability in the marine environment is affected by corrosion, both inside and outside of hollow structures, and can be particularly severe in crevices and cracks. The interior surfaces of steel tanks may also be corroded by liquids and other substances stored in them. The rate of corrosion may be increased by abrasion or erosion, and also by higher temperature, higher oxygen concentration, and the presence of chloride ions. Corrosion is therefore usually most severe in the splash zone.&lt;ref name="Gerwick 2007" /&gt;{{rp|Ch 4.2}}

====Materials====
Steels are measured by the following [[List of materials properties|material properties]]:&lt;ref name="Gerwick 2007" /&gt;{{rp|Ch 4.3}}
*Minimum [[yield strength]]
*Minimum [[ultimate strength]]
*Minimum [[Ductility|elongation at rupture]]
*[[Fracture toughness|Notch toughness]] at low temperatures
*[[Properties in the thickness direction]] (properties on the z-axis)
*[[Weldability]]
*[[Fatigue limit|Fatigue endurance]]
*[[Alloy composition]]
*[[Corrosion resistance]]

====Fabrication and Welding====
For major projects, [[coded welder]]s (approved welder, tested against a particular standard) may be stipulated, and non-destructive and mechanical testing may be specified. Design of joints and fabrication methods should take stress raisers and ambient conditions into consideration to minimise the risk of fatigue cracking, and weld preparation and finishing processes should also take this into consideration.&lt;ref name="Gerwick 2007" /&gt;{{rp|Ch 4.2}}

====Erection and assembly====
{{empty section|date=May 2023}}

====Coatings and corrosion protection====
{{See also|Cathodic protection|Galvanic corrosion|Galvanization}}

Steel is subject atmospheric corrosion, splash zone corrosion, crevice corrosion, and other causes, including corrosion due aerobic and anaerobic bacteria interacting. Seawater rates are twice that of freshwater. Coatings may delay the start of corrosion by 10 to 20 years.&lt;ref name="Gerwick 2007" /&gt;{{rp|Ch 4.2}}

When reasonably practicable, workshop conditions of suitable humidity and protection from hazardous weather should be used when painting and coating steel structures, and keeping joint surfaces clean for welding. This may require temporary shelter to be erected, and heating or dehumidification may be required.&lt;ref name="Gerwick 2007" /&gt;{{rp|Ch 4.2}}

Sacrificial anodes or impressed current cathodic protection are used to protect steel in immersed areas. Anodes must be secured to prevent damage during transport. Effective connection are required between anodes and structures. It is prohibited in en closed spaces or where gas may be trapped because hydrogen may be generated and may produce an explosive atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Gerwick 2007" /&gt;{{rp|Ch 4.2}}

Steel coatings may be applied to steel that will primarily be underwater if the coating has the required resistance to cathodic disbondment. Additional protection may be provided by materials like copper nickel or by usage of additional steel to thicken the area allowed for corrosion. Allowances of 0.1 to 0.3&amp;nbsp;mm per year are typical.&lt;ref name="Gerwick 2007" /&gt;{{rp|Ch 4.2}}

===Structural concrete===
{{See also|Concrete|Types of concrete}}

Prestressed and reinforced concrete have been used for several decades for the construction of large offshore platforms, mostly in the North Sea. Concrete is also used together with steel structure in hybrid and composite designs, and cement grout is used on steel platforms to bond piles to the skirts and jacket legs.&lt;ref name="Gerwick 2007" /&gt;{{rp|Ch 4.3.1}}

The component materials must be well matched to work effectively. It must be durable when exposes to the sea and air. Careful design and quality control during fabrication help to provide long service with low maintenance. The splash zone is most vulnerable to seawater damage, while the immersed zone and areas below the mudline have few problems. The atmospheric and splash zones have high susceptibility to chloride and carbon dioxide corrosion of the reinforcing steel.&lt;ref name="Gerwick 2007" /&gt;{{rp|Ch 4.3.1}}

====Formwork and support====

===Combined steel–concrete structures===
Two forms of combined steel and concrete construction have been used to advantage:

The hybrid approach:
* Structural steel superstructures supported by concrete substructures,
* Structural steel frames supporting exterior concrete walls and slabs,
* Steel hinge providing an articulated connection between a concrete base and a steel or concrete column. 
For these structures, the main problem is the working of the joint under cyclic-dynamic loads, which can frequently be managed by pre-stressing the connection. Care must be taken to ensure that the stresses set up by this method are of the correct type to suit each material, and that the bearing loads are evenly distributed to avoid bursting stresses.&lt;ref name="Gerwick 2007" /&gt;{{rp|Ch 4.4.1}}

The composite approach:&lt;ref name="Gerwick 2007" /&gt;{{rp|Ch 4.4.2}}

Typical examples include:
* A concrete deck is connected to a steel beam by casting it over studs welded to the beam top surface. The concrete takes compression, and the steel carries tension and transverse shear. This system is commonly used in bridge construction.&lt;ref name="Gerwick 2007" /&gt;{{rp|Ch 4.4.2}}
* Special shear connectors in the form of transverse bars or perforated vertical plates, are welded to the steel.
* Two steel plates, spaced apart and tied together by steel webs, bars, or bolts, are filled with concrete. The concrete distributes local loads and carries out of plane shear loads.&lt;ref name="Gerwick 2007" /&gt;{{rp|Ch 4.4.2}}

This type of composite construction appears to have advantages where offshore structures must withstand high local impact forces, such as ice or ship collision, and for the walls of concrete structures where cracks and leakage are unacceptable and difficult or impossible to repair.&lt;ref name="Gerwick 2007" /&gt;{{rp|Ch 4.4.2}}

===Synthetic and composite materials===
{{empty section|date=May 2023}}

===Titanium===
Titanium has high strength and is very resistant to corrosion, but is also very expensive, so it tends to be used in highly-corrosive environments or as cladding.&lt;ref name="Gerwick 2007" /&gt;{{rp|Ch 4.6}}

*[[Diving support vessel]]s
Other equipment typically used in land-based civil and structural engineering appropriate to the materials in use is also used, sometimes without modification, and sometimes modified or specially adapted to suit the working environment.

==Marine operations==
Commonly marine and offshore operations include towing, mooring, ballasting, lifting and lowering heavy loads, personnel transfer, surveying, inspection, and diving.&lt;ref name="Gerwick 2007" /&gt;{{rp|Ch 6}}

*Temporary [[buoyancy]] augmentation&lt;ref name="Gerwick 2007" /&gt;{{rp|Ch 6.8}}

===Seafloor modifications===
The seafloor may be covered with level sediments that have been consolidated over the years and provide a stable platform, but this is often not the case, and the construction site may be uneven, covered with unconsolidated, weak sediment, lie on a slope, or be irregular, with rock outcroppings or scattered boulders.&lt;ref name="Gerwick 2007" /&gt;{{rp|Ch 7.1}}

There two ways to manage an unsuitable substrate. In the past, most cases of offshore construction adapted the structure to suit the substrate, but the second method is often used for major land structures and can and has been used for shallow water harbor and coastal structures. Seafloor preparation can also have significant potential advantages for deep water. There is normally time available to prepare the site during the lead time for procurement and fabrication of the structure before installation.&lt;ref name="Gerwick 2007" /&gt;{{rp|Ch 7.1}}

Seafloor modifications to improve performance of foundations are intended to provide a stable base of sufficient strength to support the structure and to resist failure and degradation for both a single extreme event and repetitive dynamic loads. In some cases, extensions to the foundations may be placed to protect the structure moving ice or ship collision. These operations may include:&lt;ref name="Gerwick 2007" /&gt;{{rp|Ch 7.1}}

The site may be prepared by dredging, levelling and removal of obstructions.&lt;ref name="Gerwick 2007" /&gt;{{rp|Ch 7.3}} Soft material may be removed, consolidated or reinforced,&lt;ref name="Gerwick 2007" /&gt;{{rp|Ch 7.6}} and high areas of hard material and rock removed.&lt;ref name="Gerwick 2007" /&gt;{{rp|Ch 7.4}} Granular material such as crushed rock, gravel, and sand can be placed and leveled as a practicable and economical fill for a reasonably level and uniform support for structures, either across the whole site, in low areas, or as a replacement for previously removed soft materials.&lt;ref name="Gerwick 2007" /&gt;{{rp|Ch 7.5}}

Sand piles and stone columns can be used to provide better bearing strength for weak soils like silts and clays, and are installed by drilling or driving a mandrel into the soil into which the coarser material is fed before forcing it out under pressure and removing the mandrel. The process is rapid where only small areas need to be improved. This method increases both bearing and shear resistance and can prevent liquefaction. Injection of cementitious material, following land-based grouting procedures, can be used to displace pore water and give a stronger substrate. The cementing pressures must displace the water yet not cause fracturing of the formation by channelization. Cement particles must be small enough to penetrate the interstices, and a wetting agent can be added to the grout to reduce viscosity.&lt;ref name="Gerwick 2007" /&gt;{{rp|Ch 7.6}}

* Measures to prevent liquefaction of the substrate&lt;ref name="Gerwick 2007" /&gt;{{rp|Ch 7.7}}
* Protection from scour&lt;ref name="Gerwick 2007" /&gt;{{rp|Ch 7.8}}

===Installation of piles===
{{Main|Deep foundation}}
A pile or piling is a vertical or near vertical structural element of a deep foundation, driven or drilled deep into the ground at the building site. There are many reasons why a deep foundation may be preferred, such as large design loads, a poor soil at shallow depth, There are different terms used to describe different types of deep foundations including the pile (which is analogous to a pole), the pier (which is analogous to a column), drilled shafts, and caissons. Piles are generally driven into the ground in situ, and can be made out of timber, steel, reinforced concrete or prestressed concrete.

===Harbour, river and estuary structures===
{{see also|Wharf|Berth (moorings)|Dolphin (structure)|Breakwater (structure)}}
The most common type of harbour structure is the [[quay]] or [[marginal wharf]] intended for loading and unloading [[containers]]. [[Finger pier]]s are commonly used for transfer of petroleum products, and [[trestle support]]s are provided for access to loading platforms and wharves.&lt;ref name="Gerwick 2007" /&gt;{{rp|Ch 9}}

Pile-supported structures consist of steel or concrete piles, driven into soft clays and sands of the seafloor, and usually carry a deck of reinforced concrete. The piles are spaced from 7 to 10&amp;nbsp;m apart for economy, with a load bearing capacity of 100 to 250 tons each.&lt;ref name="Gerwick 2007" /&gt;{{rp|Ch 9}}

Steel piles are either H-section or tubular, with diameters from 400 to 600&amp;nbsp;mm. Tubular piles are easier to protect from corrosion.
Water depths for container and cargo ships are about 16&amp;nbsp;m, with a designed pile capacity of about 200 to 400 tons, so in most cases the pile length will be between 30 and 40&amp;nbsp;m. Larger container ships may need 20&amp;nbsp;m of water alongside, and may need piles of 40 to 50&amp;nbsp;m long to adequately support vertical crane load, and 1&amp;nbsp;m diameter for lateral stiffness. Petroleum terminals need more depth, usually about 23&amp;nbsp;m, so the piles are larger and more heavily loaded.&lt;ref name="Gerwick 2007" /&gt;{{rp|Ch 9}}

River structures include locks, low-level dams, overflow structures, and flood walls. Historically, these have usually been constructed behind sheet pile cofferdams to allow the worksite to be dewatered, so that conventional civil engineering construction methods can be used.&lt;ref name="Gerwick 2007" /&gt;{{rp|Ch 9.3}}

===Offshore platforms===

[[File:Refurbishment Platform for Drilling Rigs -- Corpus Christi.jpg|thumb|Refurbishment Station for Drilling Rigs – Corpus Christi Bay]]

An offshore platform is usually a large structure with facilities to extract and process [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]] that lie in rock formations beneath the [[seabed]]. Many platforms also have facilities to accommodate the workers, although it is also common to have a separate accommodation platform bridge linked to the production platform. Most platforms engage in activities on the [[continental shelf]], though they can also be used in lakes, inshore waters, and inland seas. Depending on the circumstances, the platform may be [[fixed Platform|fixed]] to the ocean floor, consist of an [[artificial island]], or [[floating oil production system|float]].&lt;ref name="Ronalds 2005" /&gt; In some arrangements the main facility may have storage facilities for the processed oil. Remote [[subsea]] wells may also be connected to a platform by flow lines and by [[umbilical cable|umbilical]] connections. These sub-sea facilities may include of one or more subsea wells or manifold centres for multiple wells.

===Submarine pipelines and cables===
{{main|Submarine pipeline|Submarine cable}}
A submarine pipeline is a [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]] that is laid on the [[seabed]] or below it in a trench.&lt;ref name="Dean 2020" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gerwick 2007" /&gt;{{rp|p583-585}} Some of the pipeline may also be on land.&lt;ref name="Palmer and King 2008" /&gt; Submarine pipelines are used primarily to carry oil or gas, but transportation of water is also important.&lt;ref name="Palmer and King 2008" /&gt; A distinction is sometimes made between a flowline and a pipeline.&lt;ref name="Dean 2020" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Palmer and King 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bai and Bai 2010" /&gt; The former is an intrafield pipeline, in the sense that it is used to connect subsea [[wellhead]]s, manifolds and the [[Oil platform|platform]] within a particular development field. The latter, sometimes referred to as an export pipeline, is used to bring the resource to shore.&lt;ref name="Dean 2020" /&gt; Sizeable pipeline construction projects need to take into account many factors, such as the offshore ecology, geohazards and environmental loading.&lt;ref name="Dean 2020" /&gt;
[[File:Kart rorledning lite.gif|right|thumb|Example of a submarine pipeline route: the Langeled pipeline.]]

Submarine cable is communications or electrical power cable that is laid on or under the seabed.

The '''third medium contact''' '''(TMC)''' is an implicit formulation used in [[contact mechanics]]. Contacting bodies are embedded in a highly compliant medium (the third medium), which becomes increasingly stiff under compression. The stiffening of the third medium allows tractions to be transferred between the contacting bodies when the third medium between the bodies is compressed. In itself, the method is inexact; however, in contrast to most other contact methods, the third medium approach is continuous and differentiable, which makes it applicable to applications such as [[topology optimization]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Frederiksen |first1=Andreas Henrik |last2=Sigmund |first2=Ole |last3=Poulios |first3=Konstantinos |date=2023-10-07 |title=Topology optimization of self-contacting structures |journal=Computational Mechanics |volume=73 |issue=4 |pages=967–981 |language=en |doi=10.1007/s00466-023-02396-7 |issn=1432-0924|doi-access=free |arxiv=2305.06750 |bibcode=2023CompM..73..967F }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Frederiksen |first1=Andreas H. |last2=Rokoš |first2=Ondřej |last3=Poulios |first3=Konstantinos |last4=Sigmund |first4=Ole |last5=Geers |first5=Marc G.

The method was first proposed in 2013 by {{ill|Peter Wriggers|de}}, Jörg Schröder, and Alexander Schwarz, where a [[St. Venant-Kirchhoff]] material was used to model the third medium.&lt;ref name="Wriggers2013"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Wriggers |first1=P. |last2=Schröder |first2=J. |last3=Schwarz |first3=A. |date=2013-03-30 |title=A finite element method for contact using a third medium |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00466-013-0848-5 |journal=Computational Mechanics |volume=52 |issue=4 |pages=837–847 |doi=10.1007/s00466-013-0848-5 |bibcode=2013CompM..52..837W |s2cid=254032357 |issn=0178-7675|url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach required explicit treatment of surface normals and continued to be used&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Huang |first1=Jiazhao |last2=Nguyen-Thanh |first2=Nhon |last3=Zhou |first3=Kun |date=2018-11-01 |title=An isogeometric-meshfree coupling approach for contact problems by using the third medium method |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0020740318315017 |journal=International Journal of Mechanical Sciences |volume=148 |pages=327–336 |doi=10.1016/j.ijmecsci.2018.08.031 |issn=0020-7403|url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Kruse |first1=R. |last2=Nguyen-Thanh |first2=N. |last3=Wriggers |first3=P. |last4=De Lorenzis |first4=L. |date=2018-11-01 |title=Isogeometric frictionless contact analysis with the third medium method |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00466-018-1547-z |journal=Computational Mechanics |language=en |volume=62 |issue=5 |pages=1009–1021 |doi=10.1007/s00466-018-1547-z |bibcode=2018CompM..62.1009K |issn=1432-0924|url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Khishvand |first1=Mohammad |last2=Nazem |first2=Majidreza |last3=Sloan |first3=Scott W. |last4=Carter |first4=John P. |date=2017-05-01 |title=Application of the third medium method for frictionless contact problems in geomechanics |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0266352X16303251 |journal=Computers and Geotechnics |volume=85 |pages=117–125 |doi=10.1016/j.compgeo.2016.12.020 |bibcode=2017CGeot..85..117K |issn=0266-352X|url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt; until 2017, when Bog et al. simplified the method by applying a Hencky material with the inherent property of becoming rigid under ultimate compression.&lt;ref name="Bog2015"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Bog |first1=Tino |last2=Zander |first2=Nils |last3=Kollmannsberger |first3=Stefan |last4=Rank |first4=Ernst |date=October 2015 |title=Normal contact with high order finite elements and a fictitious contact material |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.camwa.2015.04.020 |journal=Computers &amp; Mathematics with Applications |volume=70 |issue=7 |pages=1370–1390 |doi=10.1016/j.camwa.2015.04.020 |issn=0898-1221|url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt; This property made the explicit treatment of surface normals redundant, transforming the third medium contact method into a fully implicit method, contrasting with the more widely used [[Mortar methods]] or [[Penalty method]]s. However, at this stage, the third medium contact method could only handle very small degrees of sliding, and a friction model for TMC had yet to be developed. The rising popularity of Mortar methods, which emerged in the same period with a rigorous mathematical foundation and rapid development and adoption, overshadowed the TMC method.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Consequently, TMC was abandoned at an early stage and remained largely unknown in contact mechanics.

In 2021, the method was revived when Gore Lukas Bluhm, [[Ole Sigmund]], and Konstantinos Poulios worked on nonlinear buckling problems and realized that a highly compliant void material could transfer forces in a topology optimization setting. Bluhm et al. added a new regularization to stabilize the third medium, enabling the method to contact problems involving moderate sliding and thus making it practically applicable.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Bluhm |first1=Gore Lukas |last2=Sigmund |first2=Ole |last3=Poulios |first3=Konstantinos |date=2021-03-04 |title=Internal contact modeling for finite strain topology optimization |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00466-021-01974-x |journal=Computational Mechanics |volume=67 |issue=4 |pages=1099–1114 |doi=10.1007/s00466-021-01974-x |arxiv=2010.14277 |bibcode=2021CompM..67.1099B |s2cid=225076340 |issn=0178-7675}}&lt;/ref&gt; This novel regularization, known as HuHu regularization, is a general regularization technique for [[Finite element method|finite elements]] which has also been used outside TMC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Christensen |first1=C.

In 2024, Frederiksen et al.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; proposed a crystal plasticity-inspired scheme to include friction. This involved adding a term to the material model to contribute to high shear stresses in the contact interface, along with a plastic slip scheme to release shear stresses and accommodate sliding.

=== Material model ===
[[File:Uniaxial compression of neo-Hookean material.svg|thumb|Increasing strain energy density of neo-Hookean solid under uniaxial compression.|260x260px]]
TMC relies on a material model for the third medium, which stiffens under compression. The most commonly applied material models are of a [[Neo-Hookean solid|neo-Hookean]] type, characterized by a strain energy density function:

&lt;math&gt;W(\bold{u}) = \frac{K}{2}(\text{ln}|\bold{F}|)^2 + \frac{G}{2}\left( |\bold{F}|^{-2/3} ||\bold{F}| |^2 -3 \right)&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is the [[bulk modulus]], &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the [[shear modulus]], and &lt;math&gt;\bold{F}=\nabla \bold{u}+\bold{I}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[deformation gradient tensor]] of the displacement field &lt;math&gt;\bold{u}&lt;/math&gt;.

As the current material volume &lt;math&gt;|\bold{F}|&lt;/math&gt; approaches zero, this material model exhibits the characteristic of becoming infinitely stiff. Consequently, when the third medium is compressed, its volume remains positive and finite. This ensures that if two solids are embedded in a third medium with significantly lower bulk and shear moduli, the third medium can still transfer substantial forces to deform the solids when sufficiently compressed, as its stiffness becomes comparable to that of the embedded solids.

=== Regularization ===
[[File:HuHu-LuLu.svg|alt=HuHu-LuLu regularization|thumb|536x536px|Deformations targeted by HuHu and LuLu and selected element types where these deformations can be found.]]
While the neo-Hookean material model can be stable for contact without sliding, sliding often leads to instability. To address this, regularization techniques are applied to the strain energy density function.

Regularization is typically achieved by adding a regularization term to the strain energy density function of the material model. A common approach is the HuHu regularization,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; expressed as:

&lt;math&gt;\Psi(\bold{u}) = W(\bold{u}) + \mathbb{H}\bold{u} \, \boldsymbol{\scriptstyle{\vdots}} \, \mathbb{H}\bold{u}&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math display="inline"&gt; \Psi(\bold{u})&lt;/math&gt; represents the augmented strain energy density of the third medium, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\mathbb{H}\bold{u} \, \boldsymbol{\scriptstyle{\vdots}} \, \mathbb{H}\bold{u}&lt;/math&gt; is the regularization term representing the inner product of the spatial [[Hessian matrix|Hessian]] of &lt;math&gt;\bold{u}&lt;/math&gt; by itself, and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;W(\bold{u})&lt;/math&gt; is the underlying strain energy density of the third medium, e.g. a neo-Hookean solid or another [[hyperelastic material]].

The HuHu regularization was the first regularization method specifically developed for TMC. A subsequent refinement is known as the HuHu-LuLu regularization,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; expressed as:

&lt;math&gt;\Psi(\bold{u}) = W(\bold{u}) + \mathbb{H}\bold{u} \, \boldsymbol{\scriptstyle{\vdots}} \, \mathbb{H}\bold{u} - \dfrac{1}{\mathrm{Tr}(\bold{I})}\mathbb{L} \bold{u} \cdot \mathbb{L} \bold{u}&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{L}\bold{u}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Laplace operator|Laplacian]] of the displacement field &lt;math&gt;\bold{u}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\text{Tr}(\bold{I})&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Trace (linear algebra)|trace]] of the identity matrix corresponding to the problem's dimension (2D or 3D).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The LuLu term is designed to mitigate the penalization of bending and quadratic compression deformations while maintaining the penalization of excessive skew deformations, thus preserving the stabilizing properties of the HuHu regularization. This reduced penalization on bending deformations enhances the accuracy of modelling curved contacts, particularly beneficial when using coarse finite element meshes. Similarly, the reduced penalization on quadratic compression is advantageous in topology optimization applications, where finite elements with varying material densities undergo non-uniform compression.

An alternative and more complex regularization approach involves penalizing volume change and rotations, initially proposed by Faltus et al.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This approach requires further extension to 3D applications. A later improvement by Wriggers et al.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Citation |last1=Wriggers |first1=Peter |title=A Third Medium Approach for Contact Using ﬁrst and Second Order ﬁnite Elements |date=2024 |url=https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=5006163 |access-date=2025-01-13 |doi=10.2139/ssrn.5006163 |last2=Korelc |first2=Jože |last3=Junker |first3=Philipp|url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt; directly utilizes the [[Deformation gradient tensor|rotation tensor]] &lt;math&gt;\bold{R}&lt;/math&gt;  instead of the approximation used in.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Friction ===

The direction normal &lt;math&gt;\bold{n}_0&lt;/math&gt; and parallel &lt;math&gt;\bold{s}_0&lt;/math&gt; to the contact interface are defined based on the surface of the solid bed. Left and right boundaries are periodic and a displacement is enforced on &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_D&lt;/math&gt;.|300x300px]]
[[File:TMC friction model example.webm|thumb|Sliding bulge problem solved with TMC friction (Blue) and a Lagrange multiplier approach (Black) for a friction coefficient of 0.3.|384x384px]]
The integration of friction into the TMC method represents a significant advancement in simulating realistic contact conditions, addressing the previous limitations in replicating real-world scenarios. Currently, there is only one approach available for adding friction. This approach introduces shear stress to the contact and releases it through plastic slip if the contact is sliding.

When a neo-Hookean material model is used to represent the third medium, it exhibits much greater stiffness in compression compared to shear during contact. To address this and provide shear resistance, an anisotropic term is incorporated into the neo-Hookean material model. This modification rapidly builds up shear stress in compressed regions of the third medium, which is crucial for accurately modelling frictional contact.

In this formulation, the extended strain energy density expression with the added shear term is:

&lt;math&gt;W_{ext}(\bold{u}) = W(\bold{u}) + \dfrac{\beta}{2} \left( \bold{C}_e : ( \bold{s}_0 \otimes \bold{n}_0) \right)^2&lt;/math&gt;,

where:

* &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is a scaling parameter,
* &lt;math&gt;\bold{s}_0&lt;/math&gt;is a unit vector parallel to the direction of sliding,
* &lt;math&gt;\bold{n}_0&lt;/math&gt; is a unit vector perpendicular to the contact interface, and
* &lt;math&gt;\bold{C}_e = \bold{F}_e^T \cdot \bold{F}_e&lt;/math&gt; is the right [[Cauchy-Green tensor]] of the elastic deformation.

The shear extension works by penalising the contribution in &lt;math&gt;\bold{C}_e&lt;/math&gt; associated with shear in the slip direction &lt;math&gt;\bold{s}_0&lt;/math&gt;.

To release the shear stresses at the onset of sliding, a framework inspired by [[crystal plasticity]] is employed. This includes a yield criterion specifically designed to replicate the effects of Coulomb friction. This framework allows the model to simulate the onset of sliding when the shear stress, provided by the added anisotropic term, exceeds a certain threshold, effectively mimicking real-world frictional behaviour. The yield criterion, based on the Coulomb friction model, determines when sliding occurs, initiating once the shear stress surpasses a critical value.

It involves two solid beams, upper and lower, clamped at their left end. The region between the beams is considered "void" and is modelled as a third medium to allow for contact between the beams.

A vertical displacement or load is added to a small region on the upper right edge of the C-shape. The vertical displacement is prescribed such that the upper beam of the C-shape contacts the lower beam of the C-shape. When contact is established, a corner of the upper beam will slide along the lower beam, resulting in severe shear within the third medium. Additionally, the free edge on the right boundary of the third medium is not bounded, leading to severe distortions in the third medium, which are handled by the third medium material model and the applied regularization.

The C-shape problem has also been solved using the frictional TMC model.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

TMC is widely used in computational mechanics and topology optimization due to its ability to model contact mechanics in a differentiable and fully implicit manner. One of the key advantages of TMC is that it eliminates the need to explicitly define surfaces and contact pairs, thereby simplifying the modelling process.

In topology optimization, TMC ensures that sensitivities are properly handled, enabling gradient-based optimization approaches to converge effectively and produce designs with internal contact. Notable designs achieved through this approach include compliant mechanisms such as hooks, bending mechanisms, and self-contacting springs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Bluhm |first1=Gore Lukas |last2=Sigmund |first2=Ole |last3=Poulios |first3=Konstantinos |date=2023-12-01 |title=Inverse design of mechanical springs with tailored nonlinear elastic response utilizing internal contact |journal=International Journal of Non-Linear Mechanics |volume=157 |pages=104552 |doi=10.1016/j.ijnonlinmec.2023.104552 |issn=0020-7462|doi-access=free |bibcode=2023IJNLM.157j4552B }}&lt;/ref&gt; The design of metamaterials is a common application for topology optimization, where TMC has expanded the range of possible designs.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Additionally, soft springs and pneumatically activated systems, which are useful in the design of soft robots, have been modelled using TMC.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

TMC has also been extended to applications involving frictional contact and thermo-mechanical coupling.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; These advancements enhance the method’s utility in modelling real-world mechanical interfaces.

{{Orphan|date=June 2024}}

'''Safer End of Engineering Life''', sometimes abbreviated to '''SEEL''', is a concept that focuses on the importance of considering the entire lifecycle of a product or system. Currently there is a lot of focus on the decommissioning or retirement in particular industries. This includes but is not limited to [[plastic waste]], electronic waste (sometimes shorted to e-waste), and construction and [[industrial waste]].

Recently, SEEL is becoming more of a focus in fields such as [[software engineering]], [[industrial design]], and infrastructure development.

==Background==
The idea behind SEEL is to mitigate risks and ensure safety not only during the active use phase of a product but also during its end-of-life processes, such as disposal, recycling, or [[End-of-life (product)|decommissioning]]. This approach recognises that even after a product has served its intended purpose, it can still pose risks to the environment, public health, or safety if not managed properly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How do you know if drinking water is safe from forever chemicals? |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/06/24/pfas-water-forever-chemicals/ |publisher=[[Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[software engineering]], SEEL may involve designing systems with built-in mechanisms for secure data deletion, ensuring that sensitive information is properly erased when software or [[Computer hardware|hardware]] reaches the end of its useful life. It could also involve planning for software updates and patches to be maintained and deployed until the end-of-life date to address any security vulnerabilities that may arise over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=So Much for ‘Learn to Code’ |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/09/computer-science-degree-value-generative-ai-age/675452/ |publisher=[[The Atlantic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[industrial design]] and manufacturing, SEEL may include considerations for recyclability, ease of disassembly, and the use of environmentally friendly materials. By designing products with end-of-life considerations in mind, manufacturers can facilitate the [[recycling]] or repurposing of components, reducing waste and minimizing environmental impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Davis |first1=Louise |title=Using an offshore platform beyond its expected lifespan |url=https://www.engineerlive.com/content/using-offshore-platform-beyond-its-expected-lifespan |publisher=Engineer Live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent milestones==
The [[Royal Academy of Engineering]] launched a global review in January 2021 into the further study of SEEL, as well as the impacts the lack of action was having, with potential goals and aims in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Global review on Safer End of Engineered Life |url=https://engineeringx.raeng.org.uk/programmes/safer-end-of-engineered-life/global-review-on-safer-end-of-engineered-life |publisher=EngineeringX}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An international workshop was held online in May 2022 with experts from 15 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Decommissioned offshore structures could offer only limited ecological benefits, analysis of studies suggests |url=https://phys.org/news/2024-03-decommissioned-offshore-limited-ecological-benefits.html |publisher=Phys.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The workshop aimed to reflect on the progress related to the safety challenges on how to ensure the global fleet of 50,000 ships and 10,000 [[Offshore construction|offshore structure]]s can be decommissioned in an environmentally friendly way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Safer Decommissioning of Offshore Structures and Ships |url=https://engineeringx.raeng.org.uk/programmes/safer-end-of-engineered-life/safer-end-of-life-of-offshore-infrastructure-and-ships/safer-decommissioning-of-offshore-structures-and-ships |publisher=EngineeringX}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the same year, the [[European Union]] also published a report into findings on offshore decommissioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Study on decommissioning of offshore oil and gas installations |url=https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/7d7d51a5-8d44-11ec-8c40-01aa75ed71a1/language-en |publisher=[[European Union]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lowy Institute]] also published reports into the dangers of how reliant the oil and gas industries were on aging infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Parker |first1=Selwyn |title=The great offshore decommissioning |url=https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/great-offshore-decommissioning |publisher=[[Lowy Institute]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application &amp; challenges==
A main focus in recent years has been the decommissioning of offshore structures and ships. [[Oil rig]]s as one example  have a complex decommissioning process. Even after decommissioning, there may still be infrastructure remaining on the seafloor, such as well casings or pipelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Understanding Decommissioning of Offshore Infrastructures: A Legal and Economic Appetizer |url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3882821 |publisher=SSRN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decommissioning [[oil rig]]s presents numerous challenges due to technical complexity, environmental concerns, regulatory compliance, cost, legacy infrastructure, and stakeholder interests. These structures are intricate and contain various components, which requires specialised knowledge. Removal of hazardous materials can also be difficult and costly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Obsolete ships and offshore structures - an urgent safety challenge |url=https://www.theengineer.co.uk/content/opinion/obsolete-ships-and-offshore-structures-an-urgent-safety-challenge |publisher=[[The Engineer (UK magazine)|The Engineer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Catalogo velivoli'', Pàtron, 1990, &lt;small&gt;(ISBN 978-8855516693)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; designed by Italian aeronautical engineer Giuseppe Gabrielli, was one of the last high-performance aircraft equipped with a piston engine and is considered a symbol of the revival of the post-war Italian aerospace industry. It was developed from the FIAT G.55 Centauro, a World War II Italian fighter aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vintageaviationnews.com/warbirds-news/home-fiat-59.html|title=A New Home For The Fiat G 59|date=November 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FIAT G.59 was produced by FIAT in the early 1950s, with over 180 units made, primarily for the Italian Air Force as an advanced training aircraft. Powered by a Rolls-Royce Merlin V-12 engine of 1,660&amp;nbsp;hp (model 500-20), the aircraft reached a maximum speed of 609&amp;nbsp;km/h at 6,400 meters and a maximum ceiling of 12,100 meters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Ministero della Difesa Aeronautica - Direzione generale delle costruzioni ed approvvigionamenti |title=Istruzioni per l'uso del motore Rolls-Royce Merlin 500-20, FIAT, 1950 |url=http://www.avialogs.com/en/engines/united-kingdom/rolls-royce/merlin/istruzioni-per-luso-del-motore-rolls-royce-merlin-500-20.html#download |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612141439/http://www.avialogs.com/en/engines/united-kingdom/rolls-royce/merlin/istruzioni-per-luso-del-motore-rolls-royce-merlin-500-20.html#download |archive-date=12 June 2018 |language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Careers in this field focus on improving the built environment, renewable, and traditional energy industries. Industry sectors can range from government, transportation, remediation, waste management, water, sewage, consulting, fossil fuel, construction, and architectural services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=7 Different Types of Environmental Engineering Jobs |url=https://ep.jhu.edu/news/7-different-types-of-environmental-engineering-jobs/ |access-date=2023-04-21 |website=Johns Hopkins Engineering Online |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this field, solar radiation is important and must be understood. Solar radiation affects the Earth's weather and daylight available. This affects not only the Earth's environment but also the smaller internal environments which we create.&lt;ref&gt;Solar Radiation and Daylight Models, 2nd edition, T Muneer, Elsevier, Butterworth and Heinman, London, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Energy and environmental engineers acquire knowledge across many disciplines. Energy engineering requires at least an understanding of [[mechanics]], [[thermodynamics]], [[mathematics]], [[materials science|materials]], [[stoichiometry]], [[electrical machines]], [[Manufacturing|manufacturing processes]] and energy systems.

Environmental engineering can be branched into two main areas: internal environments and outdoor environments.

Internal environments may consist of housing or offices or other commercial properties. In this area, the environmental engineering sometimes stands for the designing of building services to condition the internal environment to a comfortable state or the removal of excess pollutants such as carbon dioxide or other harmful substances.&lt;ref&gt;Air Conditioning Engineering, Jones and Arnold, London 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

External environments may be water courses, [[air]], [[land]] or [[sea]]s, and may require new strategies for harnessing energy or the creation of treatment facilities for polluting technologies.

This broad degree area covers many areas but is mainly mechanically and electrically biased. It seeks to explore cleaner, more efficient ways of using [[fossil fuels]], while investigating and developing systems using renewable and sustainable resources, such as [[solar energy|solar]], [[wind power|wind]] and [[wave power|wave]] energy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courses.napier.ac.uk/U52151.htmvv]{{dead link|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
W.M. Clark, of [[South Orange, NJ]], in a book accompanying the exhibit described himself as a &lt;blockquote&gt;"hobbyist ... [who] ... through the help of the book '507 Mechanical Movements', acquired the foundation for a mechanical education, without schooling in the regular way."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;
{{cite book |last=Clark |first=William M. |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x002205697&amp;seq=9 |title=A Manual of Mechanical Movements |date=1933 |publisher=Garden City Publishing |access-date=15 Jan 2025}}
&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=April 2025}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;The exhibit, originally titled "Mechanical Wonderland," was made over "20 years" by Mr. Clark in the early 1900s and displayed in "the Boys' Department of a New York department store".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Table of Mechanical Movements.jpg|thumb|Detail of The American Artisan ser.2-v.1 1865 pg24 : A weekly journal of arts, mechanics, manufactures, engineering, chemistry, inventions, and patents]]
It was inspired by the book ''Five Hundred and Seven Mechanical Movements'' by Henry T. Brown, published in 1869.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Synchronous lateral excitation''' is a dynamic phenomenon where pedestrians walking on a footbridge subconsciously synchronize their lateral footsteps with the bridge’s natural swaying motion, amplifying lateral vibrations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news |last=Josephson |first=Brian |date=14 June 2000 |title=Out of step on the bridge |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2000/jun/14/guardianletters3 |access-date=22 March 2018 |work=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Parker |first=Matt |title=Humble Pi: A Comedy of Maths Errors |date=2019 |publisher=Penguin UK |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; First widely recognized during the 2000 opening of the [[London Millennium Bridge]], synchronous lateral excitation has since become a critical consideration in the design of lightweight pedestrian structures.&lt;ref name="ingenia"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Stabilising the London Millennium Bridge |url=https://www.ingenia.org.uk/articles/stabilising-the-london-millennium-bridge/ |website=Ingenia |date=2000-06-10 |access-date=2025-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="compdyn"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Venuti |first=Fiammetta |last2=Bruno |first2=Luca |title=Footbridge lateral vibrations induced by pedestrians |url=https://congress.cimne.com/eccomas/proceedings/compdyn2011/compdyn2011_full/179.pdf |journal=Procedia Engineering |volume=199 |pages=179–184 |year=2017 |access-date=2025-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Strogatz, Steven ''et al.''

== Mechanism ==
[[File:Synchronous lateral excitation example.png|thumb|As the number of pedestrians on a footbridge increases (black line in steps), the lateral oscillations increase (gray area). After a critical number of pedestrians is reached (166 in this example), the bridge enters a stage of synchronous lateral excitation. Simplified graph based on page 37 of Parker, Matt. Humble Pi: A Comedy of Maths Errors. Penguin UK, 2019.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;|405x405px]]
Synchronous lateral excitation arises from two interrelated synchronization processes. The first is the pedestrian-structure synchronization, where slight lateral bridge movements (e.g., from wind or random pedestrian steps) prompt walkers to adjust their gait to match the bridge’s oscillation frequency, increasing lateral forces.&lt;ref name="polito"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Venuti |first=Fiammetta |last2=Bruno |first2=Luca |title=The synchronous lateral excitation phenomenon: modelling framework and application |url=https://staff.polito.it/luca.bruno/2007b_CRM_Venuti_Bruno.pdf |journal=Comptes Rendus Mécanique |volume=336 |issue=1-2 |pages=194–199 |year=2008 |access-date=2025-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The second is pedestrian-pedestrian synchronization, where individuals unconsciously align their stepping patterns, further reinforcing the resonant force.&lt;ref name="manchester"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Modelling of lateral forces generated by pedestrians walking across footbridges |url=https://research.manchester.ac.uk/files/176996071/submitted_version_of_lateral_forces.pdf |journal=Journal of Sound and Vibration |volume=528 |pages=116938 |year=2022 |access-date=2025-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Julavitz, Robert.

== Key cases ==
* The London Millennium Bridge experienced lateral vibrations up to 70 mm due to synchronous lateral excitation, requiring a £5M retrofit with dampers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ingenia" /&gt;
* The [[Auckland Harbour Bridge]] experienced a lateral frequency of 0.67 Hz during a 1975 demonstration.&lt;ref&gt;Dallard, P. ''et al.'' [http://www.arup.com/MillenniumBridge/indepth/pdf/IStructE.pdf "The London Millennium Footbridge,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927001537/http://www.arup.com/MillenniumBridge/indepth/pdf/IStructE.pdf|date=27 September 2011}} ''Structural Engineer'', 20 November 2001. 79:22, pp. 17–35.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Birmingham NEC]] Link bridge experienced a lateral frequency of 0.7 Hz.
* The Toda Park Bridge in Japan is an early documented case (1990s) studied by Fujino et al., informing later synchronous lateral excitation models.&lt;ref name="polito" /&gt;

== Mitigation strategies ==
Some ways to avoid synchronous lateral excitation are the implementation of [[tuned mass dampers]], which were used in the Millennium Bridge to increase damping from 0.5% to 20% critical.&lt;ref name="ingenia" /&gt; Other strategies involve designing bridges with lateral frequencies outside the 0.5–1.1 Hz range as well as managing crows by limiting pedestrian density during events.&lt;ref name="compdyn" /&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of engineering}}
[[File:Grondplan citadel Lille.JPG|thumb|[[Raised-relief map|Relief map]] of the [[Citadel of Lille]], designed in 1668 by [[Vauban]], the foremost military engineer of his age]]

Engineering has existed since ancient times, when [[humans]] devised inventions such as the [[wedge]], [[lever]], [[wheel]] and [[pulley]], etc.

The term ''engineering'' is derived from the word ''engineer'', which itself dates back to the 14th century when an ''engine'er'' (literally, one who builds or operates a ''[[siege engine]]'') referred to "a constructor of military engines".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED|engineer}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, now obsolete, an "engine" referred to a military machine, ''i.e.'', a mechanical contraption used in war (for example, a [[catapult]]). Notable examples of the obsolete usage which have survived to the present day are military engineering corps, ''e.g.'', the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]].

The word "engine" itself is of even older origin, ultimately deriving from the Latin {{lang|la|ingenium}} ({{Circa|1250}}), meaning "innate quality, especially mental power, hence a clever invention."&lt;ref&gt;Origin: 1250–1300; ME engin &lt; AF, OF &lt; L ingenium nature, innate quality, esp. mental power, hence a clever invention, equiv. to in- + -genium, equiv. to gen- begetting; Source: Random House Unabridged Dictionary, Random House, Inc. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, as the design of civilian structures, such as bridges and buildings, matured as a technical discipline, the term [[civil engineering]]&lt;ref name="ECPD Definition on Britannica"/&gt; entered the lexicon as a way to distinguish between those specializing in the construction of such non-military projects and those involved in the discipline of [[military engineering]].

===Ancient era===

Other monuments, no longer standing, such as the [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]] and the [[Pharos of Alexandria]], were important engineering achievements of their time and were considered among the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]].

The six classic [[simple machines]] were known in the [[ancient Near East]]. The [[wedge]] and the [[inclined plane]] (ramp) were known since [[prehistoric]] times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moorey|first1=Peter Roger Stuart|title=Ancient Mesopotamian Materials and Industries: The Archaeological Evidence|date=1999|publisher=[[Eisenbrauns]]|isbn=978-1-57506-042-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[wheel]], along with the [[wheel and axle]] mechanism, was invented in [[Mesopotamia]] (modern Iraq) during the 5th millennium BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Companion to the Archaeology of the Ancient Near East|author=D.T.

The earliest [[Program (machine)|programmable machines]] were developed in the Muslim world. A [[music sequencer]], a programmable [[musical instrument]], was the earliest type of programmable machine.

Before the development of modern engineering, mathematics was used by artisans and craftsmen, such as [[millwright]]s, [[clockmaker]]s, instrument makers and surveyors. Aside from these professions, universities were not believed to have had much practical significance to technology.&lt;ref name="Robinson-Musnon"/&gt;{{rp|32}}

A standard reference for the state of mechanical arts during the Renaissance is given in the mining engineering treatise ''[[De re metallica]]'' (1556), which also contains sections on geology, mining, and chemistry. ''De re metallica'' was the standard chemistry reference for the next 180 years.&lt;ref name="Robinson-Musnon"/&gt;

===Modern era===
[[File:The world's first iron bridge.jpg|thumb|left|253px|The application of the steam engine allowed coke to be substituted for charcoal in [[iron]] making, lowering the cost of iron, which provided engineers with a new material for building bridges. This bridge was made of [[cast iron]], which was soon displaced by less brittle [[wrought iron]] as a structural material.]]
The science of [[classical mechanics]], sometimes called Newtonian mechanics, formed the scientific basis of much of modern engineering.&lt;ref name="Robinson-Musnon"&gt;{{cite book|title=Science and Technology in the Industrial Revolution |url=https://archive.org/details/sciencetechnolog00aemu |url-access=registration|last1=Musson|first1=A.E.|last2=Robinson|first2=Eric H.|year=1969|publisher =University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-0802016379 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the rise of engineering as a [[profession]] in the 18th century, the term became more narrowly applied to fields in which mathematics and science were applied to these ends. Similarly, in addition to military and civil engineering, the fields then known as the [[mechanic arts]] became incorporated into engineering.

[[Canal]] building was an important engineering work during the early phases of the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Transportation Revolution, 1815–1860 |last=Taylor|first= George Rogers|year=1969

&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Smeaton]] was the first self-proclaimed civil engineer and is often regarded as the "father" of civil engineering. He was an English civil engineer responsible for the design of [[bridge]]s, canals, [[harbor]]s, and [[lighthouse]]s. He was also a capable [[mechanical engineer]] and an eminent [[physicist]]. Using a model water wheel, Smeaton conducted experiments for seven years, determining ways to increase efficiency.&lt;ref name="University Of Chicago Press"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Most Powerful Idea in the World: A Story of Steam, Industry and Invention|last1=Rosen|first1= William|year= 2012 |publisher = University of Chicago Press|isbn= 978-0-226-72634-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|127}}   Smeaton introduced iron axles and gears to water wheels.&lt;ref name="Robinson-Musnon"/&gt;{{rp|69}} Smeaton also made mechanical improvements to the [[Newcomen steam engine]]. Smeaton designed the third [[Eddystone Lighthouse]] (1755–59) where he pioneered the use of '[[hydraulic lime]]' (a form of [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] which will set under water) and developed a technique involving dovetailed blocks of granite in the building of the lighthouse. He is important in the history, rediscovery of, and development of modern [[cement]], because he identified the compositional requirements needed to obtain "hydraulicity" in lime; work which led ultimately to the invention of [[Portland cement]].

Applied science led to the development of the steam engine. The sequence of events began with the invention of the [[barometer]] and the measurement of atmospheric pressure by [[Evangelista Torricelli]] in 1643, demonstration of the force of atmospheric pressure by [[Otto von Guericke]] using the [[Magdeburg hemispheres]] in 1656, laboratory experiments by [[Denis Papin]], who built experimental model steam engines and demonstrated the use of a [[piston]], which he published in 1707. [[Edward Somerset, 2nd Marquess of Worcester]] published a book of 100 inventions containing a method for raising waters similar to a [[coffee percolator]]. [[Samuel Morland]], a mathematician and inventor who worked on [[pump]]s, left notes at the Vauxhall Ordinance Office on a steam pump design that [[Thomas Savery]] read. In 1698 Savery built a steam pump called "The Miner's Friend". It employed both vacuum and pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jenkins | first = Rhys | title = Links in the History of Engineering and Technology from Tudor Times| publisher = Ayer Publishing| year = 1936 | page = 66 | isbn = 978-0-8369-2167-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iron merchant [[Thomas Newcomen]], who built the first commercial piston steam engine in 1712, was not known to have any scientific training.&lt;ref name="University Of Chicago Press"/&gt;{{rp|32}}

The application of steam-powered cast iron blowing cylinders for providing pressurized air for [[blast furnace]]s lead to a large increase in iron production in the late 18th century. The higher furnace temperatures made possible with steam-powered blast allowed for the use of more lime in [[blast furnace]]s, which enabled the transition from charcoal to [[coke (fuel)|coke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Metallurgy, Second Edition |last=Tylecote |first=R.F. |year=  1992|publisher =Maney Publishing, for the Institute of Materials |location= London|isbn=978-0-901462-88-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; These innovations lowered the cost of iron, making [[Wagonway|horse railways]] and iron bridges practical. The [[puddling process]], patented by [[Henry Cort]] in 1784 produced large scale quantities of wrought iron. [[Hot blast]], patented by [[James Beaumont Neilson]] in 1828, greatly lowered the amount of fuel needed to smelt iron. With the development of the high pressure steam engine, the power to weight ratio of steam engines made practical steamboats and locomotives possible.&lt;ref name="HunterIndustrialPower"&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730–1930, Vol. 2: Steam Power |last1=Hunter |first1= Louis C.|year=1985 | publisher =University Press of Virginia|location= Charlottesville}}&lt;/ref&gt; New steel making processes, such as the [[Bessemer process]] and the open hearth furnace, ushered in an area of heavy engineering in the late 19th century.

One of the most famous engineers of the mid-19th century was [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]], who built railroads, dockyards and steamships.

[[File:Gulf Offshore Platform.jpg|thumb|upright|Offshore platform, [[Gulf of Mexico]]]]
The [[Industrial Revolution]] created a demand for machinery with metal parts, which led to the development of several [[machine tools]]. Boring cast iron cylinders with precision was not possible until [[John Wilkinson (industrialist)|John Wilkinson]] invented his [[John Wilkinson (industrialist)#Boring machine for steam engines|boring machine]], which is considered the first [[machine tool]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Roe | first = Joseph Wickham | title = English and American Tool Builders | publisher = Yale University Press | year = 1916 | location = New Haven, Connecticut | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=X-EJAAAAIAAJ | lccn = 16011753 | access-date = November 10, 2018 | archive-date = January 26, 2021 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210126171157/https://books.google.com/books?id=X-EJAAAAIAAJ | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other machine tools included the [[screw cutting lathe]], [[milling machine]], [[turret lathe]] and the [[Planer (metalworking)|metal planer]]. Precision machining techniques were developed in the first half of the 19th century. These included the use of gigs to guide the machining tool over the work and fixtures to hold the work in the proper position. Machine tools and machining techniques capable of producing [[interchangeable parts]] lead to [[Mass production|large scale factory production]] by the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hounshell1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundations of [[electrical engineering]] in the 1800s included the experiments of [[Alessandro Volta]], [[Michael Faraday]], [[Georg Ohm]] and others and the invention of the [[electric telegraph]] in 1816 and the [[electric motor]] in 1872. The theoretical work of [[James Clerk Maxwell|James Maxwell]] (see: [[Maxwell's equations]]) and [[Heinrich Hertz]] in the late 19th century gave rise to the field of [[electronics]]. The later inventions of the [[vacuum tube]] and the [[transistor]] further accelerated the development of electronics to such an extent that electrical and electronics engineers currently outnumber their colleagues of any other engineering specialty.&lt;ref name="ECPD Definition on Britannica" /&gt;
[[Chemical engineering]] developed in the late nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="ECPD Definition on Britannica" /&gt; Industrial scale manufacturing demanded new materials and new processes and by 1880 the need for large scale production of chemicals was such that a new industry was created, dedicated to the development and large scale manufacturing of chemicals in new industrial plants.&lt;ref name="ECPD Definition on Britannica" /&gt; The role of the chemical engineer was the design of these chemical plants and processes.&lt;ref name="ECPD Definition on Britannica" /&gt; Originally deriving from the manufacture of [[ceramic]]s and its putative derivative metallurgy, materials science is one of the oldest forms of engineering.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Defonseka |first=Chris |title=Polymer Fillers and Stiffening Agents: Applications and Non-traditional Alternatives |publisher=Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG |year=2020 |isbn=978-3-11-066999-2 |location=Berlin |pages=31 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern materials science evolved directly from [[metallurgy]], which itself evolved from the use of fire. Important elements of modern materials science were products of the [[Space Race]]; the understanding and engineering of the metallic [[alloy]]s, and [[silica]] and [[carbon]] materials, used in building space vehicles enabling the exploration of space. Materials science has driven, and been driven by, the development of revolutionary technologies such as [[rubber]]s, [[plastic]]s, [[semiconductor]]s, and [[biomaterial]]s.

Aeronautical engineering deals with [[aircraft design process]] design while [[aerospace engineering]] is a more modern term that expands the reach of the discipline by including [[spacecraft]] design. Its origins can be traced back to the aviation pioneers around the start of the 20th century although the work of [[Sir George Cayley]] has recently been dated as being from the last decade of the 18th century. Early knowledge of aeronautical engineering was largely empirical with some concepts and skills imported from other branches of engineering.&lt;ref name="americana"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | author = Van Every, Kermit E. | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia Americana | title = Aeronautical engineering| year = 1986| publisher = Grolier Incorporated| volume =1| pages = 226 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only a [[decade]] after the successful flights by the [[Wright brothers]], there was extensive development of aeronautical engineering through development of military aircraft that were used in [[World War I]]. Meanwhile, research to provide fundamental background science continued by combining [[theoretical physics]] with experiments.

{{Main|List of engineering branches}}

Interdisciplinary engineering draws from more than one of the principle branches of the practice. Historically, [[naval engineering]] and [[mining engineering]] were major branches. Other engineering fields are [[manufacturing engineering]], [[acoustical engineering]], [[corrosion engineering]], [[instrumentation and control]], [[Automotive engineering|automotive]], [[information engineering]], [[petroleum engineering|petroleum]], [[systems engineering|systems]], [[audio engineering|audio]], [[software engineering|software]], [[architectural engineering|architectural]], [[biosystems engineering|biosystems]], and [[Textile manufacturing|textile]] [[nuclear engineering|engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.careercornerstone.org/pdf/nuclear/nuceng.pdf |title=Nuclear Engineering Overview |website=Career Cornerstone Center |access-date=August 2, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929162436/http://www.careercornerstone.org/pdf/nuclear/nuceng.pdf |archive-date=September 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These and other branches of engineering are represented in the 36 licensed member institutions of the UK [[Engineering Council]].

New specialties sometimes combine with the traditional fields and form new branches – for example, [[Earth systems engineering and management]] involves a wide range of subject areas including [[engineering studies]], [[environmental science]], [[engineering ethics]] and [[philosophy of engineering]].

==Practice==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2020}}
One who practices engineering is called an [[engineer]], and those licensed to do so may have more formal designations such as [[Professional Engineer]], [[Chartered Engineer]], [[Incorporated Engineer]], [[Ingenieur]], [[European Engineer]], or [[Federal Aviation Administration#Designated Engineering Representative (DER)|Designated Engineering Representative]].

==Methodology==
{{more citations needed section|date=June 2020}}
[[File:Dampfturbine Montage01.jpg|thumb|upright|Design of a [[turbine]] requires collaboration of engineers from many fields, as the system involves mechanical, electro-magnetic and chemical processes. The [[turbine blade|blades]], [[stator|rotor and stator]] as well as the [[steam cycle]] all need to be carefully designed and optimized.]]

In the [[engineering design]] process, engineers apply mathematics and sciences such as physics to find novel solutions to problems or to improve existing solutions. Engineers need proficient knowledge of relevant sciences for their design projects. As a result, many engineers continue to learn new material throughout their careers.

If multiple solutions exist, engineers weigh each design choice based on their merit and choose the solution that best matches the requirements. The task of the engineer is to identify, understand, and interpret the constraints on a design in order to yield a successful result. It is generally insufficient to build a technically successful product, rather, it must also meet further requirements.

Constraints may include available resources, physical, imaginative or technical limitations, flexibility for future modifications and additions, and other factors, such as requirements for cost, [[Safety engineering|safety]], marketability, productivity, and [[Serviceability (computer)|serviceability]]. By understanding the constraints, engineers derive [[specifications]] for the limits within which a viable object or system may be produced and operated.

===Problem solving===
[[File:Booster-Layout.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|left|A drawing for a [[steam locomotive]]. Engineering is applied to [[design]], with emphasis on function and the utilization of mathematics and science.]]
Engineers use their knowledge of [[science]], [[mathematics]], [[logic]], [[economics]], and [[empirical knowledge|appropriate experience]] or [[tacit knowledge]] to find suitable solutions to a particular problem. Creating an appropriate [[mathematical model]] of a problem often allows them to analyze it (sometimes definitively), and to test potential solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.livescience.com/47499-what-is-engineering.html|title=What is engineering?  |last=Lucas |first=Jim |website=Live Science |date=August 22, 2014|language=en|access-date=September 15, 2019|archive-date=July 2, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190702140957/https://www.livescience.com/47499-what-is-engineering.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than one solution to a design problem usually exists so the different [[design choice]]s have to be evaluated on their merits before the one judged most suitable is chosen. [[Genrich Altshuller]], after gathering statistics on a large number of [[patent]]s, suggested that [[compromise]]s are at the heart of "[[level of invention|low-level]]" engineering designs, while at a higher level the best design is one which eliminates the core contradiction causing the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theoriesaboutengineering.org/genrich_altshuller.html|website=Theories About Engineering |title= Genrich Altshuller's Theory of Inventive Problem Solving |access-date=September 15, 2019|archive-date=September 11, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190911220432/http://theoriesaboutengineering.org/genrich_altshuller.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Engineers typically attempt to predict how well their designs will perform to their specifications prior to full-scale production. They use, among other things: [[prototype]]s, [[scale model]]s, [[simulation]]s, [[destructive testing|destructive tests]], [[nondestructive testing|nondestructive tests]], and [[stress testing|stress tests]]. Testing ensures that products will perform as expected but only in so far as the testing has been representative of use in service. For products, such as aircraft, that are used differently by different users failures and unexpected shortcomings (and necessary design changes) can be expected throughout the operational life of the product.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/engineering-design-process/engineering-design-compare-scientific-method|title=Comparing the Engineering Design Process and the Scientific Method|website=Science Buddies|language=en-US|access-date=September 15, 2019|archive-date=December 16, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191216191107/https://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/engineering-design-process/engineering-design-compare-scientific-method|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Engineers take on the responsibility of producing designs that will perform as well as expected and, except those employed in specific areas of the [[arms industry]], will not harm people. Engineers typically include a [[factor of safety]] in their designs to reduce the risk of unexpected failure.

The study of failed products is known as [[forensic engineering]]. It attempts to identify the cause of failure to allow a redesign of the product and so prevent a re-occurrence. Careful analysis is needed to establish the cause of failure of a product. The consequences of a failure may vary in severity from the minor cost of a machine breakdown to large loss of life in the case of accidents involving aircraft and large stationary structures like buildings and dams.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.asce.org/forensic-engineering/forensic-engineering/|title=Forensic Engineering {{!}} ASCE|website=www.asce.org|access-date=September 15, 2019|archive-date=April 8, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200408165523/https://www.asce.org/forensic-engineering/forensic-engineering/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computer use===
[[File:CFD Shuttle.jpg|thumb|left|A computer simulation of high velocity air flow around a [[Space Shuttle orbiter]] during re-entry. Solutions to the flow require [[Finite element method|modelling]] of the combined effects of [[Navier–Stokes equations|fluid flow]] and the [[heat equation]]s.]]

As with all modern scientific and technological endeavors, computers and software play an increasingly important role. As well as the typical business [[application software]] there are a number of computer aided applications ([[computer-aided technologies]]) specifically for engineering. Computers can be used to generate models of fundamental physical processes, which can be solved using [[numerical method]]s.

[[File:WorldWideWebAroundWikipedia.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Graphic representation of a minute fraction of the WWW, demonstrating [[hyperlink]]s]]
One of the most widely used [[design tool]]s in the profession is [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) software. It enables engineers to create 3D models, 2D drawings, and schematics of their designs. CAD together with [[digital mockup]] (DMU) and [[Computer-aided engineering|CAE]] software such as [[Finite element method|finite element method analysis]] or [[analytic element method]] allows engineers to create models of designs that can be analyzed without having to make expensive and time-consuming physical prototypes.

These allow products and components to be checked for flaws; assess fit and assembly; study ergonomics; and to analyze static and dynamic characteristics of systems such as stresses, temperatures, electromagnetic emissions, electrical currents and voltages, digital logic levels, fluid flows, and kinematics. Access and distribution of all this information is generally organized with the use of [[product data management]] software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

There are also many tools to support specific engineering tasks such as [[computer-aided manufacturing]] (CAM) software to generate [[CNC]] machining instructions; [[manufacturing process management]] software for production engineering; [[Electronic design automation|EDA]] for [[printed circuit board]] (PCB) and circuit [[schematic]]s for electronic engineers; [[Maintenance, repair, and operations|MRO]] applications for maintenance management; and Architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) software for civil engineering.

In recent years the use of computer software to aid the development of goods has collectively come to be known as [[product lifecycle management]] (PLM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Social context==
[[File:Kismet-IMG 6007-gradient.jpg|thumb|left|[[Robotic]] [[Kismet (robot)|Kismet]] can produce a range of facial expressions.]]
The engineering profession engages in a range of activities, from collaboration at the societal level, and smaller individual projects. Almost all engineering projects are obligated to a funding source: a company, a set of investors, or a government. The types of engineering that are less constrained by such a funding source, are ''[[pro bono]]'', and [[open-design]] engineering.

Engineering has interconnections with society, culture and human behavior. Most products and constructions used by modern society, are influenced by engineering. Engineering activities have an impact on the environment, society, economies, and public safety.

Engineering projects can be controversial. Examples from different engineering disciplines include: the development of [[nuclear weapon]]s, the [[Three Gorges Dam]], the design and use of [[sport utility vehicle]]s and the extraction of [[Fuel oil|oil]]. In response, some engineering companies have enacted serious [[Corporate social responsibility|corporate and social responsibility]] policies.

The attainment of many of the [[Millennium Development Goals]] requires the achievement of sufficient engineering capacity to develop infrastructure and sustainable technological development.&lt;ref name="MDG"&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.sistech.co.uk/media/ICEBrunelLecture2006.pdf?Docu_id=1420&amp;faculty=14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061006054029/http://www.sistech.co.uk/media/ICEBrunelLecture2006.pdf?Docu_id=1420&amp;faculty=14 |archive-date=October 6, 2006|url-status=dead|title = Engineering Civilisation from the Shadows|last = Jowitt|first = Paul W.|date = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ElementBlack2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Radar, [[GPS]], [[lidar]], etc. are all combined to provide proper navigation and [[obstacle avoidance]] (vehicle developed for 2007 [[DARPA Urban Challenge]]).]]

Overseas development and relief NGOs make considerable use of engineers, to apply solutions in disaster and development scenarios. Some charitable organizations use engineering directly for development:
* [[Engineers Without Borders]]
* [[Engineers Against Poverty]]
* Registered Engineers for Disaster Relief
* [[Engineers for a Sustainable World]]
* [[Engineering for Change]]
* Engineering Ministries International&lt;ref name="EMI"&gt;[http://www.emiusa.org/index.html Home page for EMI] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414014038/http://emiusa.org/index.html |date=April 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Engineering companies in more developed economies face challenges with regard to the number of engineers being trained, compared with those retiring. This problem is prominent in the UK where engineering has a poor image and low status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineeringuk.com/About_us/|title=engineeringuk.com/About_us|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140530210132/http://www.engineeringuk.com/About_us/|archive-date=May 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are negative economic and political issues that this can cause, as well as ethical issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgededwards.co.uk/policy/why-does-it-matter-why-are-engineering-skills-important |title=Why Does It Matter? – why are engineering skills important? |author= George Edwards |access-date=June 19, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20140619142335/http://www.georgededwards.co.uk/policy/why-does-it-matter-why-are-engineering-skills-important |archive-date=June 19, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is agreed the engineering profession faces an "image crisis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgededwards.co.uk/the-era-foundation-report.html |title=The ERA Foundation Report |author= George Edwards |access-date=June 19, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006103241/http://www.georgededwards.co.uk/the-era-foundation-report.html |archive-date=October 6, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK holds the [[:Category:Engineering companies by country|most engineering companies]] compared to other European countries, together with the United States.{{citation needed|date=December 2023}}

===Code of ethics===
{{Main|Engineering ethics}}
Many [[engineering societies]] have established codes of practice and [[engineering ethics|codes of ethics]] to guide members and inform the public at large. The [[National Society of Professional Engineers]] code of ethics states:
{{blockquote| Engineering is an important and learned profession. As members of this profession, engineers are expected to exhibit the highest standards of honesty and integrity. Engineering has a direct and vital impact on the quality of life for all people. Accordingly, the services provided by engineers require honesty, impartiality, fairness, and equity, and must be dedicated to the protection of the public health, safety, and welfare. Engineers must perform under a standard of professional behavior that requires adherence to the highest principles of ethical conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nspe.org/resources/ethics/code-ethics|title=Code of Ethics|publisher=National Society of Professional Engineers|access-date=July 12, 2017|archive-date=February 18, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200218064318/https://www.nspe.org/resources/ethics/code-ethics|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In Canada, engineers wear the [[Iron Ring]] as a symbol and reminder of the obligations and ethics associated with their profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ironring.ca/ |title=Origin of the Iron Ring concept |access-date=August 13, 2021 |archive-date=April 30, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430202754/http://www.ironring.ca/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There exists an overlap between the sciences and engineering practice; in engineering, one applies science. Both areas of endeavor rely on accurate observation of materials and phenomena. Both use mathematics and classification criteria to analyze and communicate observations.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Scientists may also have to complete engineering tasks, such as designing experimental apparatus or building prototypes. Conversely, in the process of developing technology, engineers sometimes find themselves exploring new phenomena, thus becoming, for the moment, scientists or more precisely "engineering scientists".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.esm.psu.edu/academics/undergraduate/what-is-engineering-science.aspx |title=What is Engineering Science? |website=esm.psu.edu |access-date=September 7, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220516163509/https://www.esm.psu.edu/academics/undergraduate/what-is-engineering-science.aspx |archive-date=2022-05-16 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of this is the use of numerical approximations to the [[Navier–Stokes equations]] to describe aerodynamic flow over an aircraft, or the use of the [[finite element method]] to calculate the stresses in complex components.

As stated by Fung ''et al.'' in the revision to the classic engineering text ''Foundations of Solid Mechanics'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Engineering is quite different from science. Scientists try to understand nature. Engineers try to make things that do not exist in nature. Engineers stress innovation and invention. To embody an invention the engineer must put his idea in concrete terms, and design something that people can use. That something can be a complex system, device, a gadget, a material, a method, a computing program, an innovative experiment, a new solution to a problem, or an improvement on what already exists. Since a design has to be realistic and functional, it must have its geometry, dimensions, and characteristics data defined. In the past engineers working on new designs found that they did not have all the required information to make design decisions. Most often, they were limited by insufficient scientific knowledge. Thus they studied [[mathematics]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]] and [[mechanics]]. Often they had to add to the sciences relevant to their profession. Thus engineering sciences were born.&lt;ref name="Fung"&gt;{{cite book|title=Classical and Computational Solid Mechanics, YC Fung and P. Tong|publisher=World Scientific|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although engineering solutions make use of scientific principles, engineers must also take into account safety, efficiency, economy, reliability, and constructability or ease of fabrication as well as the environment, ethical and legal considerations such as patent infringement or liability in the case of failure of the solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nspe.org/resources/ethics/code-ethics|title=Code of Ethics {{!}} National Society of Professional Engineers|website=www.nspe.org|access-date=September 10, 2019|archive-date=February 18, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200218064318/https://www.nspe.org/resources/ethics/code-ethics|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of the human body, albeit from different directions and for different purposes, is an important common link between medicine and some engineering disciplines. [[Medicine]] aims to sustain, repair, enhance and even replace functions of the [[human body]], if necessary, through the use of [[technology]].

Conversely, some engineering disciplines view the human body as a biological machine worth studying and are dedicated to emulating many of its functions by replacing [[biology]] with technology. This has led to fields such as [[artificial intelligence]], [[Artificial neural network|neural networks]], [[fuzzy logic]], and [[robot]]ics. There are also substantial interdisciplinary interactions between engineering and medicine.&lt;ref name="IME"&gt;[http://www.uphs.upenn.edu/ime/mission.html Institute of Medicine and Engineering: Mission statement The mission of the Institute for Medicine and Engineering (IME) is to stimulate fundamental research at the interface between biomedicine and engineering/physical/computational sciences leading to innovative applications in biomedical research and clinical practice.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317145554/http://www.uphs.upenn.edu/ime/mission.html |date=March 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IEEE"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=51 |title=IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology: Both general and technical articles on current technologies and methods used in biomedical and clinical engineering ... |access-date=March 30, 2007 |archive-date=February 13, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213074931/http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=51 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both fields provide solutions to real world problems. This often requires moving forward before phenomena are completely understood in a more rigorous scientific sense and therefore experimentation and empirical knowledge is an integral part of both.

Medicine, in part, studies the function of the human body. The human body, as a biological machine, has many functions that can be modeled using engineering methods.&lt;ref name="Royal Academy"&gt;[http://www.acmedsci.ac.uk/images/pressRelease/1170256174.pdf Royal Academy of Engineering and Academy of Medical Sciences: Systems Biology: a vision for engineering and medicine in pdf: quote1: Systems Biology is an emerging methodology that has yet to be defined quote2: It applies the concepts of systems engineering to the study of complex biological systems through iteration between computational or mathematical modelling and experimentation.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070410011033/http://www.acmedsci.ac.uk/images/pressRelease/1170256174.pdf |date=April 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newly emerging branches of science, such as [[systems biology]], are adapting analytical tools traditionally used for engineering, such as systems modeling and computational analysis, to the description of biological systems.&lt;ref name="Royal Academy"/&gt;

===Art===
[[File:Leonardo da Vinci - presumed self-portrait - WGA12798.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Leonardo da Vinci]], seen here in a self-portrait, has been described as the epitome of the artist/engineer.&lt;ref name="Bjerklie, David"/&gt; He is also known for his studies on [[human anatomy]] and [[physiology]].]]
There are connections between engineering and art, for example, [[architecture]], [[landscape architecture]] and [[industrial design]] (even to the extent that these disciplines may sometimes be included in a university's [[Faculty (division)|Faculty]] of Engineering).&lt;ref name="National Science Foundation:The Art of Engineering"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=107990&amp;org=NSF |title=National Science Foundation:The Art of Engineering: Professor uses the fine arts to broaden students' engineering perspectives |access-date=April 6, 2018 |archive-date=September 19, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180919211145/https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=107990&amp;org=NSF |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MIT World:The Art of Engineering"&gt;[http://mitworld.mit.edu/video/362/ MIT World:The Art of Engineering: Inventor James Dyson on the Art of Engineering: quote: A member of the British Design Council, James Dyson has been designing products since graduating from the Royal College of Art in 1970.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060705232213/http://mitworld.mit.edu/video/362/ |date=July 5, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="University of Texas at Dallas"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://iiae.utdallas.edu/ |title=University of Texas at Dallas: The Institute for Interactive Arts and Engineering |access-date=March 30, 2007 |archive-date=April 3, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403182106/http://iiae.utdallas.edu/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among famous historical figures, [[Leonardo da Vinci]] is a well-known [[Renaissance]] artist and engineer, and a prime example of the nexus between art and engineering.&lt;ref name="Bjerklie, David"&gt;Bjerklie, David. "The Art of Renaissance Engineering." ''MIT's Technology Review'' Jan./Feb.1998: 54–59. Article explores the concept of the "artist-engineer", an individual who used his artistic talent in engineering. Quote from article: Da Vinci reached the pinnacle of "artist-engineer"-dom, Quote2: "It was Leonardo da Vinci who initiated the most ambitious expansion in the role of artist-engineer, progressing from astute observer to inventor to theoretician." (Bjerklie 58)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Drew U"&gt;[http://www.users.drew.edu/~ejustin/leonardo.htm Drew U: user website: cites Bjerklie paper] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070419194433/http://www.users.drew.edu/~ejustin/leonardo.htm |date=April 19, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business===

[[Business engineering]] deals with the relationship between professional engineering, IT systems, business administration and [[change management]]. [[Engineering management]] or "Management engineering" is a specialized field of [[management]] concerned with engineering practice or the engineering industry sector. The demand for management-focused engineers (or from the opposite perspective, managers with an understanding of engineering), has resulted in the development of specialized engineering management degrees that develop the knowledge and skills needed for these roles. During an engineering management course, students will develop [[industrial engineering]] skills, knowledge, and expertise, alongside knowledge of business administration, management techniques, and strategic thinking. Engineers specializing in change management must have in-depth knowledge of the application of [[industrial and organizational psychology]] principles and methods. Professional engineers often train as [[certified management consultant]]s in the very specialized field of [[management consulting]] applied to engineering practice or the engineering sector. This work often deals with large scale complex [[business transformation]] or [[business process management]] initiatives in aerospace and defence, automotive, oil and gas, machinery, pharmaceutical, food and beverage, electrical and electronics, power distribution and generation, utilities and transportation systems. This combination of technical engineering practice, management consulting practice, industry sector knowledge, and change management expertise enables professional engineers who are also qualified as management consultants to lead major business transformation initiatives. These initiatives are typically sponsored by C-level executives.

===Other fields===
In [[political science]], the term ''engineering'' has been borrowed for the study of the subjects of [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] and [[political engineering]], which deal with forming [[political structure|political]] and [[social structure]]s using engineering methodology coupled with [[political science]] principles. [[Marketing engineering]] and [[financial engineering]] have similarly borrowed the term.

The '''aerospike engine''' is a type of [[rocket engine]] that maintains its [[aerodynamic]] efficiency across a wide range of [[altitude]]s.&lt;ref name=factsheet&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/news/background/facts/aerospike.html|title=NASA - Linear Aerospike Engine fact sheet (08/00)|website=www.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=2020-01-21|archive-date=18 July 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230718095241/https://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/news/background/facts/aerospike.html|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; It belongs to the class of [[altitude compensating nozzle]] engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Defusca|first1=Albert|last2=Craddock|first2=Christopher|date=1 November 2017|title=Affordable Access to Low Earth Orbit|url=https://www.dsiac.org/resources/journals/dsiac/fall-2017-volume-4-number-4/affordable-access-low-earth-orbit|journal=DSIAC Journals|volume=4|issue=4|access-date=16 June 2019|archive-date=25 December 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211225092014/https://www.dsiac.org/resources/journals/dsiac/fall-2017-volume-4-number-4/affordable-access-low-earth-orbit|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aerospike engines were proposed for many [[single-stage-to-orbit]] (SSTO) designs. They were a contender for the [[Space Shuttle main engine]]. However, as of 2023 no such engine was in commercial production, although some large-scale aerospikes were in testing phases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/x-33/aerospik.htm|title=Aerospike Engine Homepage|website=www.hq.nasa.gov|access-date=27 August 2020|archive-date=23 May 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220523204457/https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/x-33/aerospik.htm|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''aerospike'' was originally used for a truncated [[plug nozzle#In rockets|plug nozzle]] with a rough conical taper and some gas injection, forming an "air spike" to help make up for the absence of the plug tail. However, a full-length plug nozzle may also be called an aerospike.

==Principles==
The purpose of any engine bell is to direct the exhaust of a rocket engine in one direction, generating thrust in the opposite direction. The exhaust, a high-temperature mix of gases, has an effectively random momentum distribution (i.e., the exhaust pushes in any direction it can).  If the exhaust is allowed to escape in this form, only a small part of the flow will be moving in the correct direction and thus contribute to forward thrust.  The bell redirects exhaust moving in the wrong direction so that it generates thrust in the correct direction.  Ambient air pressure also imparts a small pressure against the exhaust, helping to keep it moving in the "right" direction as it exits the engine.  As the vehicle travels upward through the atmosphere, ambient air pressure is reduced.  This causes the thrust-generating exhaust to begin to expand outside the edge of the bell.  Since this exhaust begins traveling in the "wrong" direction (i.e., outward from the main exhaust plume), the efficiency of the engine is reduced as the rocket travels because this escaping exhaust is no longer contributing to the thrust of the engine.  An aerospike rocket engine seeks to eliminate this loss of efficiency.&lt;ref name=factsheet/&gt;

[[File:Aerospikeprinciplediagram.svg|thumb|Comparison between the design of a [[bell-nozzle]] rocket (left) and an aerospike rocket (right)]]

Instead of firing the exhaust out of a small hole in the middle of a bell, an aerospike engine avoids this random distribution by firing along the outside edge of a wedge-shaped protrusion, the "spike", which serves the same function as a traditional engine bell. The spike forms one side of a "virtual" bell, with the other side being formed by the outside air.&lt;ref name=factsheet/&gt;

The idea behind the aerospike design is that at low altitude the ambient pressure compresses the exhaust against the spike. Exhaust recirculation in the base zone of the spike can raise the pressure in that zone to nearly ambient. Since the pressure in front of the vehicle is ambient, this means that the exhaust at the base of the spike nearly balances out with the drag experienced by the vehicle.  It gives no overall thrust, but this part of the nozzle also doesn't ''lose'' thrust by forming a partial vacuum.  The thrust at the base part of the nozzle can be ignored at low altitude.&lt;ref name=factsheet/&gt;

As the vehicle climbs to higher altitudes, the air pressure holding the exhaust against the spike decreases, as does the drag in front of the vehicle. The recirculation zone at the base of the spike maintains the pressure in that zone to a fraction of 1 [[bar (unit)|bar]], higher than the near-vacuum in front of the vehicle, thus giving extra thrust as altitude increases.  This effectively behaves like an "altitude compensator" in that the size of the bell automatically compensates as air pressure falls.&lt;ref name=factsheet/&gt;

The disadvantages of aerospikes seem to be extra weight for the spike. Furthermore, the larger cooled area can reduce performance below theoretical levels by reducing the pressure against the nozzle. Aerospikes work relatively poorly between [[Mach number|Mach]] 1–3, where the airflow around the vehicle has reduced the pressure, thus reducing the thrust.&lt;ref name="nozzledesign"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ww17.pwrengineering.com/articles/nozzledesign.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402105625/http://www.pwrengineering.com/articles/nozzledesign.htm|url-status=dead|title=Pwrengineering.com|archive-date=2 April 2010|website=ww17.pwrengineering.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Variations===
Several versions of the design exist, differentiated by their shapes. In the '''toroidal aerospike''' the spike is bowl-shaped with the exhaust exiting in a ring around the outer rim. In theory this requires an infinitely long spike for best efficiency, but a similar effect can be achieved by blowing a small amount of gas out of the center of a shorter truncated spike (like [[base bleed]] in an artillery shell).

In the '''linear aerospike''' the spike consists of a tapered wedge-shaped plate, with exhaust exiting on either side at the "thick" end. This design has the advantage of being stackable, allowing several smaller engines to be placed in a row to make one larger engine while augmenting steering performance with the use of individual engine throttle control.

==Performance==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Annular-Aerospike.jpg|thumb|[[Rocketdyne]]'s [[J-2 (rocket engine)|J-2T-250k]] annular aerospike test firing.]] --&gt;
[[Rocketdyne]] conducted a lengthy series of tests in the 1960s on various designs. Later models of these engines were based on their highly reliable [[J-2 (rocket engine)|J-2]] engine machinery and provided the same sort of thrust levels as the conventional engines they were based on; 200,000 [[pound-force|lbf]] (890 [[Newton (unit)|kN]]) in the '''J-2T-200k''', and 250,000&amp;nbsp;lbf (1.1 MN) in the '''J-2T-250k''' (the T refers to the toroidal combustion chamber). Thirty years later their work was revived for use in [[NASA]]'s [[X-33]] project. In this case the slightly upgraded J-2S engine machinery was used with a linear spike, creating the '''[[Rocketdyne XRS-2200|XRS-2200]]'''. After more development and considerable testing, this project was cancelled when the X-33's composite fuel tanks repeatedly failed.
 
[[File:Aerospike close-up.jpg|thumb|[[CSULB]] aerospike engine]]
Three XRS-2200 engines were built during the X-33 program and underwent testing at NASA's [[John C. Stennis Space Center|Stennis Space Center]]. The single-engine tests were a success, but the program was halted before the testing for the two-engine setup could be completed. The XRS-2200 produces {{convert|204420|lbf|abbr=on}} thrust with an [[Specific impulse|I&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;]] of 339 seconds at sea level, and {{convert|266230|lbf|abbr=on}} thrust with an I&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt; of 436.5 seconds in a vacuum.

The RS-2200 Linear Aerospike Engine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RS-2200|url=http://www.astronautix.com/r/rs-2200.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161228055938/http://astronautix.com/r/rs-2200.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=28 December 2016|website=Astronautix.com|access-date=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; was derived from the XRS-2200. The RS-2200 was to power the [[VentureStar]] [[single-stage-to-orbit]] vehicle. In the latest design, seven RS-2200s producing {{convert|542000|lbf|kN}} each would boost the VentureStar into low Earth orbit. The development on the RS-2200 was formally halted in early 2001 when the [[X-33]] program did not receive [[Space Launch Initiative]] funding. [[Lockheed Martin]] chose to not continue the VentureStar program without any funding support from NASA. An engine of this type is on outdoor display on the grounds of the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville Alabama.

[[File:Non-truncated toroidal aerospike nozzle.jpg|thumb|[[NASA]]'s toroidal aerospike nozzle]]
The [[Lockheed Martin X-33#Cancellation|cancellation of the Lockheed Martin X-33]] by the federal government in 2001 decreased funding availability, but aerospike engines remain an area of active research. For example, a milestone was achieved when a joint academic/industry team from [[California State University, Long Beach]] (CSULB) and [[Garvey Spacecraft Corporation]] successfully conducted a flight test of a liquid-propellant powered aerospike engine in the [[Mojave Desert]] on 20 September 2003. CSULB students had developed their Prospector 2 (P-2) rocket using a 1,000&amp;nbsp;lb&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; (4.4&amp;nbsp;kN) LOX/ethanol aerospike engine. This work on aerospike engines continues; Prospector-10, a ten-chamber aerospike engine, was test-fired 25 June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csulb.edu/colleges/coe/mae/views/projects/rocket/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615154007/http://www.csulb.edu/colleges/coe/mae/views/projects/rocket/|url-status=dead|title=CSULB CALVEIN Rocket News and Events|archive-date=15 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nozzle performance comparison.svg|thumb|Nozzle performance comparison of [[bell nozzle|bell]] and aerospike nozzle]]

Further progress came in March 2004 when two successful tests sponsored by the NASA [[Dryden Flight Research Center]] using high-power rockets manufactured by [[Blacksky Corporation]], based in [[Carlsbad, California]]. The aerospike nozzles and solid rocket motors were developed and built by the rocket motor division of [[Cesaroni Technology Incorporated]], north of Toronto, Ontario. The two rockets were solid-fuel powered and fitted with non-truncated toroidal aerospike nozzles. Flown at the Pecos County Aerospace Development Center, Fort Stockton, Texas, the rockets achieved apogees of {{convert|26000|ft|m|abbr=on}} and speeds of about [[Mach number|Mach]] 1.5.

Small-scale aerospike engine development using a [[hybrid rocket]] propellant configuration has been ongoing by members of the [[Reaction Research Society]].

In 2020 the [[TU Dresden]] and [[Fraunhofer IWS]] started their CFDμSAT-Project for research on additively manufactured aerospike-engines. A prototype has already been tested in a test cell at TU Dresden's Institute of Aerospace Engineering, achieving a burn time of 30 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TU-Dresden Homepage|url=https://tu-dresden.de/tu-dresden/profil/exzellenz/news/3D-Raketentriebwerk?set_language=en|website=tu-dresden.de|access-date=23 April 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implementations ==
=== Firefly Aerospace ===
In July 2014 [[Firefly Aerospace|Firefly Space Systems]] announced its planned Alpha launcher that uses an aerospike engine for its first stage. Intended for the small satellite launch market, it is designed to launch satellites into low-Earth orbit (LEO) at a price of US$8–9&amp;nbsp;million, much lower than with conventional launchers.&lt;ref name=giz1407&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmag.com/firefly-alpha-aerospike-launch-vehicle/32892 |title=Firefly Space Systems unveils Alpha launch vehicle design with aerospike engine |publisher=Gizmag.com |date= 14 July 2014|access-date=2014-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Firefly Alpha]] 1.0 was designed to carry payloads of up to {{convert|400|kg}}. It uses carbon composite materials and uses the same basic design for both stages. The plug-cluster aerospike engine puts out {{convert|90000|lbf|kN}} of thrust. The engine has a bell-shaped nozzle that has been cut in half, then stretched to form a ring with the half-nozzle now forming the profile of a plug.&lt;ref name=giz1407/&gt;

This rocket design was never launched. The design was abandoned after Firefly Space Systems went bankrupt. A new company, [[Firefly Aerospace]], has replaced the aerospike engine with a conventional engine in the Alpha 2.0 design. However, the company has proposed Firefly Gamma, a partially reusable spaceplane with aerospike engines.

=== ARCA Space ===
In March 2017 [[ARCA Space Corporation]] announced their intention to build a [[single-stage-to-orbit]] (SSTO) rocket, named [[Haas (rocket)#Haas 2CA|Haas 2CA]], using a linear aerospike engine. The rocket is designed to send up to 100&amp;nbsp;kg into low-Earth orbit, at a price of US$1&amp;nbsp;million per launch.&lt;ref name="ARCA"&gt;{{cite web|title=ARCA News|url=http://www.arcaspace.com/en/news.htm|website=ARCA Space|access-date=30 May 2018|archive-date=23 November 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221123200938/https://www.arcaspace.com/en/news.htm|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; They later announced that their Executor Aerospike engine would produce {{convert|50500|lbf|kN}} of thrust at sea level and {{convert|73800|lbf|kN}} of thrust in a vacuum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Haas 2CA Specs |url=http://www.arcaspace.com/en/Haas_2CA/specs.htm |website=ARCA Space |access-date=30 May 2018 |archive-date=30 May 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180530002103/http://www.arcaspace.com/en/Haas_2CA/specs.htm |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, ARCA announced that they would fly their Demonstrator3 rocket to space, also using a linear aerospike engine. This rocket was designed to test several components of their Haas 2CA at lower cost. They announced a flight for August 2017.&lt;ref name="ARCA"/&gt;  In September 2017, ARCA announced that, after being delayed, their linear aerospike engine was ready to perform ground tests and flight tests on a Demonstrator3 rocket.&lt;ref name="ARCA"/&gt;

On 20 December 2019, ARCA tested the LAS 25DA aerospike steam rocket engine for the Launch Assist System.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Flight of the Aerospike: Episode 34 - LAS 25DA Aerospike Engine |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnrTrsRskp8  |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/WnrTrsRskp8| archive-date=2021-12-11 |url-status=live|website=Youtube | date=30 December 2019 |publisher=ARCA Space |access-date=5 August 2020}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===KSF Space and Interstellar Space===
Another spike engine concept model, by KSF Space and Interstellar Space in Los Angeles, was designed for orbital vehicle named SATORI.

=== Rocketstar ===
Rocketstar planned to launch its 3D-printed aerospike rocket to an altitude of 50 miles in February 2019 but canceled the mission three days ahead of liftoff citing safety concerns. They are working on a second launch attempt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2021-09-27|title=RocketStar ready for second suborbital flight attempt|url=https://spacenews.com/rocketstar-ready-for-second-suborbital-flight-attempt/|access-date=2021-12-14|website=SpaceNews|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Business administration}}
[[File:Asset Allocation.pdf|thumb|right|250px|[[Modern portfolio theory]] suggests a diversified portfolio of [[shares]] and other [[asset classes]] (such as debt in [[corporate bonds]], [[treasury bond]]s, or [[money market funds]]) will realise more predictable returns if there is prudent market regulation.]]
'''Asset management''' is a systematic approach to the governance and realization of all value for which a group or [[Entity#In law, politics, economics, accounting|entity]] is responsible. It may apply both to tangible [[asset]]s (physical objects such as complex process or manufacturing plants, infrastructure, buildings or equipment) and to intangible assets (such as [[intellectual property]], [[goodwill (accounting)|goodwill]] or [[financial assets]]). Asset management is a systematic process of developing, operating, maintaining, upgrading, and disposing of assets in the most cost-effective manner (including all costs, risks, and performance attributes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Why Industry Needs Asset Management Tools |date=2001 |url=https://nrc-publications.canada.ca/eng/view/accepted/?id=42a6857e-f63a-470b-8c33-23097fb93fff |publisher=American Society of Civil Engineers|doi=10.1061/(ASCE)0887-3801(2001)15:1(35) |last1=Vanier |first1=D. J. "Dana" |journal=Journal of Computing in Civil Engineering |volume=15 |pages=35–43 |s2cid=110643751 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theory of asset management primarily deals with the [[accounting period|periodic]] matter of improving, maintaining or in other circumstances assuring the economic and capital [[Valuation (finance)#Net asset value method|value]] of an asset over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Asset management techniques |journal=International Journal of Electrical Power &amp; Energy Systems |date=2006 |volume=28 |issue=9 |pages=643–654 |doi=10.1016/j.ijepes.2006.03.007 |url=http://www.montefiore.ulg.ac.be/services/stochastic/pscc05/papers/fp1000.pdf |access-date=15 March 2023 |last1=Schneider |first1=Joachim |last2=Gaul |first2=Armin J. |last3=Neumann |first3=Claus |last4=Hogräfer |first4=Jürgen |last5=Wellßow |first5=Wolfram |last6=Schwan |first6=Michael |last7=Schnettler |first7=Armin }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is commonly used in engineering, the business world, and [[public infrastructure]] sectors to ensure a coordinated approach to the [[optimization]] of costs, risks, service/performance, and sustainability. The term has traditionally been used in the financial sector to describe people and companies who manage investments on behalf of others. Those include, for example, [[Investment management|investment managers]] who manage the assets of a [[pension fund]].

The [[ISO 55000]] series of standards, developed by [[ISO/TC 251|ISO TC 251]], are the international standards for Asset Management. [[ISO 55000]] provides an introduction and requirements specification for a management system for asset management. The [[ISO 55000]] standard defines an asset as an "item, thing or entity that has potential or actual value to an organization". ISO 55001 specifies requirements for an asset management system within the context of the organization, and ISO 55002 gives guidelines for the application of an asset management system, in accordance with the requirements of ISO 55001.

==By industry==

===Financial asset management===
The most frequent usage of the term [[portfolio manager]] (asset manager) refers to [[investment management]], the sector of the [[financial services]] industry that manages [[investment fund]]s and [[Security segregation|segregated client accounts]]. Asset management is part of a financial company that employs experts who manage money and handle the investments of clients. This is done either actively or passively.

* [[Active management|Active asset management]]: involves active tasks such as studying the client's assets to plan and look after the investments, all things are looked after by the asset managers, and recommendations are provided based on the financial health of each client. Active asset management comes at a higher price to investors because more work is involved.
* [[Passive management|Passive asset management]]: assets are allocated to mirror a market or a sector index. Unlike active asset management, passive asset management is a lot less laborious. It is also less tailored, requires less looking after, and consequently is cheaper for investors. Benjamin Braun&lt;ref name="Braun"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Braun |first1=Benjamin |editor1-last=Hacker |editor1-first=J. S. |editor2-last=Hertel-Fernandez |editor2-first=A. |editor3-last=Pierson |editor3-first=P. |editor4-last=Thelen |editor4-first=K. |title=Asset Manager Capitalism as a Corporate Governance Regime |journal=American Political Economy:  Politics, Markets, and Power |date=18 June 2020 |doi=10.31235/osf.io/v6gue |url=https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/v6gue |access-date=7 August 2024 |publisher=SocArXiv |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that, since American stock ownership is concentrated on few big asset managers which are very diversified and do not have a direct interest in the performance of the companies, this emerging "asset manager capitalism" is distinct from the earlier [[shareholder primacy]].

===Physical and Infrastructure asset management===
{{main|Infrastructure asset management}}
Physical and Infrastructure asset management is the combination of management, financial, economic, engineering, and other practices applied to physical assets to provide the best value level of service for the costs involved. It includes the management of the entire life cycle—including design, construction, commissioning, operating, maintaining, repairing, modifying, replacing, and decommissioning/disposal—of physical and infrastructure assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.https://www.amcouncil.com.au/knowledge/what-is-asset-management.html|title=What is Asset Management|website=amcouncil.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; Operation and maintenance of assets in a constrained budget environment require a prioritization scheme. As a way of illustration, the recent development of [[renewable energy]] has seen the rise of effective asset managers involved in the management of solar systems (solar parks, rooftops, and windmills). These teams often collaborate with financial asset managers in order to offer [[turnkey]] solutions to investors.

Infrastructure asset management became very important in most of the developed countries in the 21st century, since their infrastructure network was almost completed in the 20th century and they have to manage to operate and maintain them cost-effectively.&lt;ref&gt;Vanier, D. (2001) Why Industry Needs Asset Management Tools. ASCE Journal of Computing in Civil Engineering. Vol 15(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

Physical, or Infrastructure Asset Management is a growing specialist engineering discipline, with many international technical societies now established to advance knowledge in this area, including the Engineers Australia technical society of the Asset Management Council (AMC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amcouncil.com.au|title=The Asset Management Council|website=amcouncil.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; the World Partners in Asset Management (WPiAM),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wpiam.com|title=World Partners in Asset Management|website=wpiam.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Society for Maintenance and Reliability Professionals (SMRP),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smrp.org|title=Society for Maintenance and Reliability Professionals|website=smrp.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Institute of Asset Management (IAM),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theiam.org|title=The Institute of Asset Management|website=theiam.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; the International Society of Engineering Asset Management (ISEAM),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iseam.org|title=The International Society on Engineering Asset Management|website=iseam.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Global Forum on Maintenance and Asset Management (GFMAM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gfmam.org|title=Global Forum on Maintenance and Asset Management|website=gfmam.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Engineering asset management===
Engineering asset management&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wceam.com|title=World Congress on Engineering Asset Management|website=wceam.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a more recent term that is used to describe the management of complex physical assets, a specific engineering practice that is concerned with optimizing assets, in the context of the organizations goals and objectives, through using multidiscipline engineering methodologies, and [[Terotechnology]] (which includes management, engineering, and financial expertise), to balance cost, risk, and performance. Engineering asset management includes multiple engineering disciplines, including but not limited to [[maintenance engineering]], [[systems engineering]], [[reliability engineering]], [[process safety management]], [[industrial engineering]], and [[Risk analysis (engineering)|risk analysis]]. Engineering asset management is a term synonymous with physical and infrastructure asset management, it is used to describe management of more complex physical assets which require the application of specialist asset management engineering methods over their life-cycles in order to maximize value for their owners, whilst keeping risk to an acceptable level.

===Natural asset companies===
[[File:Lahad-Datu Sabah Panoramic-view-from-Tower-of-Heaven-02.jpg|thumb|On October 28, 2021, political leaders in the Malaysian state of Sabah on the island of Borneo signed an agreement with the Singapore shell company Hoch Standard, without the knowledge of Indigenous communities, giving the company title to the management and marketing of “natural capital/ecosystem services” on two million hectares of a forest ecosystem for one hundred to two hundred years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Foster |first=John Bellamy |date=March 2022 |title=The Defense of Nature: Resisting the Financializaton of the Earth |url=https://monthlyreview.org/2022/04/01/the-defense-of-nature-resisting-the-financializaton-of-the-earth/#lightbox/0/ |journal=Monthly Review |volume=73 |issue=10 |pages=np |via=Monthly Review website}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In September 2021, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and ''Intrinsic Exchange Group'' (IEG) jointly announced the development of natural asset companies (NACs), a new class of publicly tradable securities that hold rights to, and manage the productivity and ecological benefits of, 'natural assets' such as forests, marine areas, peatlands and farmland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=IEG |title=How NAC's Work |url=https://www.intrinsicexchange.com/nacs |access-date=Jan 17, 2024 |website=Intrinsic Exchange Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in response to the UN Rio+20 Summit of 2012 and the 2020 Global Biodiversity Framework “living in harmony with nature by 2050”, where the United Nations bodies called for financial instruments to attend to the collapse of global biodiversity. The UN Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) asserts that "nature must become a central pillar of economic and financial decision-making".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=United Nations Capital Development Fund |first=(UNCDF) |access-date=January 18, 2024 |title=Nature Asset |url=https://www.uncdf.org/nature-assets |website=UNCDF.ORG}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, they have proposed that there must be a strategic shift from viewing nature as a resource or 'externality' to treating nature as an asset.

NACs attempt to assign value to 'ecosystem services' – such as carbon retention, freshwater generation, pest control, groundwater storage and erosion prevention. Criticism's of these newly emerging forms of asset question the financial industries capacities given their historical legacies, as well their ongoing expropriation of land and labour. Critics also suggest rendering the processes of life itself into commodities to be hoarded and traded by undemocratic and unregulated financial management companies and multi national corporations is not a responsible mode of stewardship for the perils of the planet during the '6th mass extinction'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Fries |first=Lynn |date=July 8, 2022 |title=The Capitalist Solution to ‘Save’ the Planet: Make It an Asset Class &amp; Sell it |quote=John Bellamy Foster explains the ‘solution’ master-minded by global finance to resolve the imminent environmental crisis: create a multi-quadrillion dollars’ worth of assets on the back of everything nature does and expropriate it from the global commons to make a profit. Worse still: it is already happening. |url=https://gpenewsdocs.com/the-capitalist-solution-to-save-the-planet-make-it-an-asset-class-sell-it/ |url-status= |archive-url= |access-date=Jan 18, 2024 |work=GPENewsdocs |pages=np}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Foster |first=John Bellamy |date=Mar 1, 2022 |title=Nature as a Mode of Accumulation: Capitalism and the Financialization of the Earth |url=https://monthlyreview.org/2022/03/01/nature-as-a-mode-of-accumulation-capitalism-and-the-financialization-of-the-earth/ |journal=Monthly Review |publisher=Monthly Review |publication-date=March 2022 |volume=73 |issue=10 |via=Monthly Review website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Software asset management===
{{main|Software asset management}}
SAM is a sub-discipline of [[IT asset management]].

===ISO standard for asset management===
The International Organization for [[Standardization]] published its management system standard for asset management in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iso.org/standard/55088.html|title=ISO 55000:2014 – Asset management — Overview, principles, and Terminology|publisher=International Organization for Standardization|access-date=August 21, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ISO 55000]] series provides terminology, requirements, and guidance for implementing, maintaining and improving an effective asset management system. The key to forming a structure of this sort is directly connected to local governance.

* Physical asset management: the practice of managing the entire life cycle (design, construction, commissioning, operating, maintaining, repairing, modifying, replacing, and decommissioning/disposal) of physical and infrastructure assets such as structures, production, and service plant, power, water, and waste treatment facilities, distribution networks, transport systems, buildings, and other physical assets.  The increasing availability of data from asset systems is allowing the principles of [[Total Cost of Ownership]] to be applied to facility management of an individual system, a building, or across a campus.  Physical asset management is related to [[asset health management]].
*[[Infrastructure asset management]] expands on this theme in relation primarily to the public sector, [[utilities]], property, and transport systems. Additionally, Asset Management can refer to shaping the future interfaces between the human, built, and natural environments through collaborative and evidence-based decision processes
*[[Fixed assets management]]: an accounting process that seeks to track fixed assets for [[financial accounting]]
*[[IT asset management]]: the set of business practices that join financial, contractual, and inventory functions to support life cycle management and strategic decision making for the IT environment. 
*[[Digital asset management]]: a form of electronic media [[content management]] that includes digital assets

===Enterprise asset management===
[[Enterprise asset management]] (EAM) systems are asset ''information'' systems that support the management of an organization's assets.   An EAM includes an asset registry (inventory of assets and their attributes) combined with a [[computerized maintenance management system]] (CMMS) and other modules (such as inventory or materials management). Assets that are geographically distributed, interconnected or networked, are often also represented through the use of [[Geographic information system|geographic information systems (GIS)]].

GIS-centric asset registry standardizes data and improves interoperability, providing users the capability to reuse, coordinate, and share information efficiently and effectively. A GIS platform combined with information of both the "hard" and "soft" assets helps to remove the traditional silos of departmental functions. While the [[hard asset]]s are the typical physical assets or infrastructure assets, the soft assets might include permits, licenses, brands, patents, right-of-ways, and other entitlements or valued items.

The EAM system is only one of the 'enablers' of good asset management.  Asset managers need to make informed decisions to fulfill their organizational goals, this requires good asset information but also leadership, clarity of strategic priorities, competencies, inter-departmental collaboration and communications, workforce, and supply chain engagement, risk and change management systems, performance monitoring, and continual improvement.

===Public asset management===
Public asset management expands the definition of enterprise asset management (EAM) by incorporating the management of all things of value to a municipal [[jurisdiction]] and its citizens' expectations. An example in which public asset management is used is land-use development and planning.

==Intellectual and non-physical asset management==
Increasingly both consumers and organizations use assets, e.g. software, music, books, etc. where the user's rights are constrained by a license agreement. An asset management system would identify the constraints upon such licenses, e.g. a period. If, for example, one licenses software, often the license is for a given period. Adobe and Microsoft both offer time-based software licenses. In both the corporate and consumer worlds, there is a distinction between software ownership and the updating of software. One may own a version of the software, but not newer versions of the software. Cellular phones are often not updated by vendors, in an attempt to force a purchase of newer hardware. Large companies such as [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], that license software to clients distinguish between the right to use and the right to receive maintenance/support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2491993,00.asp|title=The Best Asset Management Software of 2018|website=pcmag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''stepped profile''' describes the edge of something that has a series of defined steps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=https://www.telaztec.com/Resources/ICHAztecWalesJuly06.pdf |last=Cowan |first=James J. |title=Advances in holographic replication with the Aztec structure |conference=7th International Symposium on Display Holography |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has applications in architecture, construction, [[Profile (engineering)|engineering]], and geology.

==Applications==
===Architecture and construction===
In [[building design]] a stepped profile is used to reduce the visual impact of, or airborne noise around a building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gc15AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63 |page=63 |title=The Modern Airport Terminal: New Approaches to Airport Architecture |first=Brian |last=Edwards |year=2004 |isbn=9781134537648 |publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bi5dDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA62 |page=62 |title=Greener Buildings: Environmental Impact of Property |first=Stuart |last=Johnson |year=1993 |isbn=9781349227525 |publisher=[[Macmillan Education]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Making of an African Building: The Mpumalanga Provincial Government Complex |page=32 |isbn=9780620282949 |year=2001 |publisher=MPTS Architectural Library |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9bUVAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; A stepped profile is also used to calculate seismic and wind loads in multi-story building design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IJ0tCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA54 |page=54 |title=Energy Audits and Improvements for Commercial Buildings |first=Ian M. |last=Shapiro |year=2016 |isbn=9781119084167 |publisher=[[Wiley (publisher)|Wiley]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Spillway#Stepped spillway|spillway]] from a [[dam]] can have a stepped profile, which dissipates energy from the released water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=H. |last=Chanson |title=History of stepped channels and spillways: a rediscovery of the "wheel" |journal=Canadian Journal of Civil Engineering |year=1995 |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=247–259 |doi=10.1139/l95-034|url=https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:9293/ARTI_10.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Engineering===
In engineering, a stepped profile may be used on a [[bearing (mechanical)|bearing]] surface to reduce friction between the moving parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wróblewski, E. |author2=Iskra, A. |author3=&amp; Babiak, M |year=2017 |title=Geometrical structures of the stepped profile bearing surface of the piston |journal=Procedia Engineering |volume=192 |pages=965–970 |doi=10.1016/j.proeng.2017.06.166 |publisher=[[Elsevier]]|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geology===
A [[mountain]] with a stepped profile has a number of [[denudation]] terraces caused by erosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3E6qBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA64 |page=64 |title=Landforms of High Mountains |author1=Alexander Stahr |author2=Ewald Langenscheidt |year=2014 |isbn=9783642537158 |publisher=[[Springer Berlin Heidelberg]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[river]] with a stepped profile has a step-like variation in its gradient along its length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QWDQ7ezcjbcC |page=79 |title=A view of the river |author=Luna Bergere Leopold |year=1994 |isbn=9780674937321 |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be caused by changes in the height of the underlying bedrock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L2ZFVunPMPwC&amp;pg=PT409 |page=409 |title=Geomorphology and River Management: Applications of the River Styles Framework |author1=Gary J. Brierley |author2=Kirstie A. Fryirs |year=2013 |isbn=9781118685303 |publisher=[[Wiley (publisher)|Wiley]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable examples==
* [[Altar Mountain]], a mountain in [[Victoria Land]], [[Antarctica]]
* [[Drapers' Gardens]], an office block in the [[City of London]], [[United Kingdom]]
* [[Cairn of Barnenez]], a [[Neolithic]] monument in [[Brittany]], [[France]]

'''Texnikoi''' ('''TNK''') is an honorary organization for students in the College of Engineering at [[Ohio State University]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]], United States. It was established in 1924 and recognizes both academic achievement and campus and extra-curricular involvement.

==History==
'''Texnikoi Engineering Honorary Fraternity''' was founded on {{dts|1924|11|05}} at [[Ohio State University]] as an honorary organization for students in the College of Engineering. At the time this organization was founded, many students felt that some effort should be made to recognize outstanding work in the extra-curricular field. The founders of Texnikoi include:
{{columns-list|colwidth=15em| 
* Arthur C. Avril
* Peter B. Baggs
* Edward Burkhalter
* Jesse R. Glaeser
* Richard R. Grant
* Charles L. Lockett
* Howard L. Matthews
* Donald F. McChurchy
* George R. Miller
* Loren A. Murphy
* Herman F. Nofer
* Albert Ward Ross Jr. 
* Hoyt L. Sherman
* Edmund D. Watts
* Rolland P. Wood
* Clarence T. Woodward
}}Its purpose is to give due recognition to those members of the College of Engineering who have distinguished themselves as campus leaders while maintaining, at the same time, a commendable academic record. Avril was the main founder and first president of the organization. Although he graduated from Ohio State in {{dts|1925}}, he remained in close contact with Texnikoi until he died in {{dts|1996|07}}.

In 1989, Avril raised close to $250,000 for the Texnikoi by auctioning off his 1954 Mercedes Benz 300SL [[Gull-wing door|Gullwing]]. This donation has allowed for the thousands of dollars in scholarships for outstanding members and for the coverage of operating expenses of the society
==Symbols ==
Texnikoi's colors are black and yellow.

The three main values of Texnikoi are:

*'''Participation''' in activities
*'''Leadership''' in organizations
*'''Service''' to the university and the community
The Texnikoi plaque is a hand-crafted representation of the Texnikoi symbol. At the beginning of every initiation period, members are instructed to make a plaque to represent the symbol of Texnikoi. Initiates are only given an unfinished die cast of the TNK symbol and criteria as to which the aspects of the plaque must fall into. Plaques are due before initiation and then given back to the newly initiated members as a symbol of membership. Alumni who have lost their plaques may request a new one be made by contacting the current President or Adviser of Texnikoi.

==Activities==
Texnikoi meets once a month during the regular school year. Meetings serve two purposes: i) to inform members of the upcoming service, philanthropy, and social events, and ii) to allow engineers to meet other engineers and create a social network.

Each year the active membership of Texnikoi selects an alumnus of the College of Engineering to receive the Texnikoi Outstanding Alumni Award. The award was first presented in 1955.'''&lt;ref name="Texnikoi Outstanding Alumni Award"&gt;{{cite web |title=Texnikoi Outstanding Alumni Award |url=http://www.eng.ohio-state.edu/alumni/buckeye/texnikoi.php |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513171950/http://www.eng.ohio-state.edu/alumni/buckeye/texnikoi.php |archivedate=2008-05-13 |accessdate=2008-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;''' Recipients are under the age of forty, have risen rapidly in the field of engineering, have made outstanding contributions through civic and social activities, and has not received prior departmental recognition.'''&lt;ref name="Texnikoi Outstanding Alumni Award" /&gt;''' The precedence has been established that a department should not be considered for two years after one of its alumni receives the award. Notable recipients of the award include [[Tamer Ibrahim]] in 2013.

The society also awards scholarships to its members annually.

== Membership ==
Texnikoi admits 25 inductees each year, from a variety of engineering specializations. Potential members must be an engineering student at Ohio State University with an above-average cumulative [[GPA]] and a status of at least [[sophomore]]. Members are then chosen by their level of extra-curricular activity. The number of activities participated in by a student is not necessarily indicative of his/her qualification for membership in this fraternity, but rather how he/she has assumed active leadership, administrative ability, and integrity.Membership applications are reviewed annually in early November.

== Notable members ==

ISO 24517-1:2008 is an [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] Standard published in 2008.

* Document management—Engineering document format using PDF—Part 1: Use of PDF 1.6 (PDF/E-1)

This standard defines a format (PDF/E) for the creation of documents used in [[geospatial]], [[construction]] and [[manufacturing]] [[workflows]]&lt;ref name="PDF/E-ISO-Standard"&gt; [http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=42274 ISO 24517-1:2008 - Document management -- Engineering document format using PDF -- Part 1: Use of PDF 1.6 (PDF/E-1)]&lt;/ref&gt; and is based on the PDF Reference version 1.6 from [[Adobe Systems]]. The specification also supports interactive media, including animation and 3D.

PDF/E is a subset of [[PDF]], designed to be an open and neutral exchange format for engineering and technical documentation.&lt;ref name="pdf/e-ready-guide"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160304091414/http://www.adobe.com/enterprise/pdfs/pdf-eready-guide-ue.pdf Creating PDF/E-ready files]&lt;/ref&gt;  For PDF 2.0, PDF/E-1 is superseded by the [[PDF/A|PDF/A-4e]] conformance level.

==Description==

The PDF/E Standard specifies how the Portable Document Format (PDF) should be used for the creation of documents in engineering workflows.

Key benefits of PDF/E include:
* Reduces requirements for expensive &amp; proprietary software
* Lower storage and exchange costs (vs. paper)
* Trustworthy exchange across multiple applications and platforms
* Self-contained
* Cost-effective and accurate means of capturing markups
* Developed and maintained by the PDF/E ISO committee

The Standard does not define a method for the creation or conversion from paper or electronic documents to the PDF/E format.

The Committee managing ISO 24517 (PDF/E) needs subject-matter experts to assist in the development of Part 2 of the Standard.

ISO 24517 (PDF/E) was created to meet the needs of organizations who need to reliably create, exchange and review engineering documentation, however, the first part of the standard does not address 3D, video or other dynamic content, nor does it address integrated source data.

'''Technical Integrity Engineering''', also known as '''Asset Integrity''', involves various [[engineering]] disciplines that focus on ensuring a product, process, or system meets its intended requirements when used. Applying these disciplines to reduce costs, maintain schedules, manage technical risks, and handle legal concerns during a project's entire life cycle ensures operational safety and efficiency in e.g., [[Oil and Gas]], [[Power Generation]], and [[Nuclear power|Nuclear Power]] industries.

Integrity Engineering is a profession that uses [[science]], [[Mathematics|math]], [[economics]], [[social]] insights, [[Law|legal]] knowledge, and practical skills to ensure that products and systems are not only safe but also meet their legal and business requirements. Integrity Engineers perform tasks such as organizing inspections, managing integrity programs, and making sure plant facilities, including structures, [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]]s, equipment, and piping systems, remain in good condition.

For [[Integrity management|Integrity Management]], it's crucial that Integrity Engineers make independent, impartial decisions to ensure equipment is designed, maintained, operated, and decommissioned following the best industry practices. This independence helps maintain a high level of integrity and safety.

==Scope==

Integrity Engineers may be required to manage, develop, or conduct the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Madkour |first=Professor Dr Loutfy H. |url=https://www.academia.edu/14714300 |title=INDUSTRIAL CORROSION AND CORROSION CONTROL TECHNOLOGY|pages=449–555 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A high-level integrity management philosophy that includes verification and assurance of facilities (basic repair methods and strategies, Static equipment repair and temporary repairs, Fabric maintenance, [[Corrosion Engineering]], Inspection Engineering, Chemical management, and Maintenance Management)
* A Competency Management scheme
* An RBI analysis
* Integrity processes, i.e., Write Risk-Based Inspection methodologies, Temporary Repair methodologies, Maintenance Strategies, Mechanical Integrity Management Strategy (MIMS), Structural Integrity Management Strategy (SIMS), Pipeline Integrity Management Strategy (PIMS), Well Integrity Management System (WIMS), and create corrosion circuits for the plant process
* Verification schemes and performance standards management
* Conduct life extension studies
* A Fitness-for-service review
* Write and review [[integrity Management Plan]]s
* Identify, investigate and assess deterioration/corrosion and ensure timely maintenance of the affected facilities.
* Implement Inspection and [[Corrosion]] Control Policy and [[Risk Based Inspection]] (RBI) methods to manage integrity, and optimize inspections frequency, maintenance cost, and plant availability
* Lead and conduct RBI reviews
* Participate in the preparation of Capital and Operating budgets for Inspection
* Monitor and oversee the execution of inspection programs and activities
* Liaise closely with Operations, Technical Services, [[Corrosion engineering]], Inspection Engineering, Verification Engineering, Process/Chemical and [[Mechanical Engineering]] and other Maintenance Units to coordinate major shutdowns and turn-around activities
* Supervise, witness, and participate in the certification process of hydro tests and load tests of lifting devices and cylinders
* Ensure systematic and consistent implementation of work methods and procedures used in Maintenance and Inspection and recommend improvements
* Ensure systematic update of maintenance management systems
* Participate in technical studies, Process and Instrument diagram reviews, Safety Integrity Level (SIL) assessments and HAZOPs
* Lead in failure investigations
*Input and control of asset integrity management software
 
Integrity Engineering encompasses the concept of:
* Organize, review, analyze, improve and control cycle  
* Consistency of actions, values, methods, measures, principles, expectations, and outcomes
* An undivided or unbroken completeness or totality with nothing wanting
* Knowledge of many interfaces of technology
* Balancing and countering the materials degradation process during the in-service life cycle of equipment
*Ensuring the recommended risk mitigation actions derived from the RBI study are implemented
*Ensuring inspection intervals are not exceeded
*Ensuring resources are available for RBI Assessments

This may be applied to management, machines, devices, systems, materials, and processes that safely realize improvements to the lives of assets.

The Integrity Engineer (IE) may also be involved with other asset life-cycle issues, such as the basis of design (Process design basis) through to recycling. The Front End Engineering Design stage (FEED) aids in the selection of vessels, piping, pipelines, and other equipment. At this FEED stage, the optimum material requirements, mitigation, and maintenance requirements for the intended period of operation become the basis for detailed engineering. It is the role of the IE to develop/validate the integrity management plan and implement the monitoring and management procedure for the intended period of operation. It may also be the responsibility of the integrity engineer to incorporate and manage any variation identified (metal loss, material degradation, cracking mechanisms, mitigation issues, i.e. [[Cathodic protection]] potentials, coating failures, etc.) during the monitoring regime.

It may be a generalist in nature and/or applied with specific prior knowledge denoted using a pre-nominal of Mechanical, Inspection, Asset, Well or Wellhead, Technical, Pipeline, Signal, Fabrication, or Commissioning depending upon the equipment or system under scrutiny.

Integrity Engineers construct and implement Integrity Management plans that detail the requirements of the item or asset under scrutiny and study any adverse effects from internal or external sources that damage / impair that item or system. These are used to build suitable inspection and condition monitoring forward strategies. The monitoring may include physical (pipes/vessels) and nonphysical systems (Management legal obligations). This diversity will depend upon the requirements of the task at hand.

Integrity Engineers also oversee or carry out [[Integrity Engineering Audit]](s) to ensure legal compliance with company, national and international standards and ensure quality assurance within the process that meets good engineering standards.

It is a key enabling technology for [[quantum optics]] and optical [[Quantum technology|quantum technologies]]. SNSPDs are available with very high detection efficiency, very low dark count rate and very low timing jitter, compared to other types of single-photon detectors. SNSPDs are covered by [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC) international standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=IEC 61788-22-3:2022 {{!}} IEC Webstore |url=https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/63471#:~:text=IEC%2061788-22-3:2022%20is%20applicable%20to%20the,and%20operating%20temperature%20(T). |access-date=2023-04-29 |website=webstore.iec.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2023, commercial SNSPD devices are available in multichannel systems in a price range of 100,000 euros.

It was recently discovered that superconducting wires as wide as 1.5 μm can detect single infra-red photons.&lt;ref&gt;Luskin et al. (2023). “Large active-area superconducting microwire detector array with single-photon sensitivity in the near-infrared”, Appl. Phys.

(2023). “Superconducting wide strip photon detector with high critical current bank structure”, Optica Quantum, 1: 26-34&lt;/ref&gt; This is important because optical lithography rather than electron lithography can be used in their construction. This reduces the cost for applications that require large photodetector areas. One application is in dark matter detection experiments, where the target is a scintillating GaAs crystal. GaAs suitably doped with silicon and boron is a luminous cryogenic scintillator that has no apparent afterglow and is available commercially in the form of large, high-quality crystals.&lt;ref&gt;Derenzo, S.; Bourret, E.; Hanrahan, S.; Bizarri, G.

== Principle of operation ==
The SNSPD consists of a thin (≈ 5&amp;nbsp;nm) and narrow (≈ 100&amp;nbsp;nm) [[superconductivity|superconducting]] [[Niobium nanowire|nanowire]]. The length is typically hundreds of [[micrometre|micrometers]], and the nanowire is patterned in a compact meander geometry to create a square or circular pixel with high detection efficiency. The nanowire is cooled well below its superconducting critical temperature and biased with a DC [[electric current|current]] that is close to but less than the superconducting critical current of the nanowire. A [[photon]] incident on the nanowire breaks [[Cooper pairs]] and reduces the local critical current below that of the bias current. This results in the formation of a localized non-superconducting region, or hotspot, with finite [[electrical resistance]]. This resistance is typically larger than the 50&amp;nbsp;ohm input [[nominal impedance|impedance]] of the readout amplifier, and hence most of the bias current is shunted to the amplifier. This produces a measurable voltage pulse that is approximately equal to the bias current multiplied by 50&amp;nbsp;ohms. With most of the bias current flowing through the amplifier, the non-superconducting region cools and returns to the superconducting state. The time for the current to return to the nanowire is typically set by the inductive time constant of the nanowire, equal to the [[kinetic inductance]] of the nanowire divided by the impedance of the readout circuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1063/1.2183810 | title=Kinetic-inductance-limited reset time of superconducting nanowire photon counters | year=2006 | last1=Kerman | first1=Andrew J. | last2=Dauler | first2=Eric A. | last3=Keicher | first3=William E. | last4=Yang | first4=Joel K.

For complete systems, COP calculations should include energy consumption of all power consuming auxiliaries.

This force and the law for quantifying it, represent one of the most basic forms of force used in the physical sciences, and were an essential basis to the study and development of the theory and field of [[classical electromagnetism]].

: &lt;math&gt;F=k_e\frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;,

The force of the interaction between the charges is attractive if the charges have opposite signs (i.e., ''F'' is negative) and repulsive if like-signed (i.e., ''F'' is positive).

Being an [[inverse-square law]], the law is analogous to [[Isaac Newton]]'s inverse-square [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|law of universal gravitation]]. Coulomb's law can be used to derive [[Gauss's law]], and vice versa.}}

''Diamagnetism'' is a [[quantum mechanical]] effect that occurs in all materials; when it is the only contribution to the magnetism, the material is called diamagnetic. In paramagnetic and ferromagnetic substances the weak diamagnetic force is overcome by the attractive force of [[magnetic dipole]]s in the material. The [[permeability (electromagnetism)|magnetic permeability]] of diamagnetic materials is less than μ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the permeability of vacuum.

For a beam with an applied weight &lt;math&gt;w(x) &lt;/math&gt;, taking downward to be positive, the internal [[shear force]] is given by taking the negative integral of the weight:
: &lt;math&gt;V(x)=-\int w(x)\, dx&lt;/math&gt;
The internal moment M(x) is the integral of the internal shear:
: &lt;math&gt;M(x)=\int V(x)\, dx&lt;/math&gt;=&lt;math&gt; -\int [\int w(x)\ \, dx] dx &lt;/math&gt;

The [[angle of rotation]] from the horizontal, &lt;math&gt; \theta&lt;/math&gt;, is the integral of the internal moment divided by the product of the [[Young's modulus]] and the [[second moment of area|area moment of inertia]]:
: &lt;math&gt;\theta (x)=\frac{1}{EI} \int M(x)\, dx &lt;/math&gt;

Following these successful demonstrations, it quickly became a cornerstone of engineering and an enabler of the [[Second Industrial Revolution]]. Additional [[mathematical models]] have been developed such as [[plate theory]], but the simplicity of beam theory makes it an important tool in the sciences, especially [[structural engineering|structural]] and [[mechanical engineering]].}}

{{term|term=[[Faraday constant]]|content='''[[Faraday constant]]'''}}{{defn|defn=Denoted by the symbol {{math|''F''}} and sometimes stylized as ℱ, is named after [[Michael Faraday]]. In [[physics]] and [[chemistry]], this constant represents the magnitude of [[electric charge]] per [[mole (unit)|mole]] of [[electron]]s.&lt;ref&gt;The term "magnitude" is used in the sense of "[[absolute value]]": The charge of an electron is negative, but ''F'' is always defined to be positive.&lt;/ref&gt; It has the value
: {{physconst|F|after=.}}

This constant has a simple relation to two other physical constants:
: &lt;math&gt;F = eN_\text{A}&lt;/math&gt;
where
: {{physconst|e|symbol=yes|after=;}}
: {{physconst|NA|symbol=yes|after=.}}
Both of these values have exact defined values, and hence ''F'' has a known exact value. ''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Avogadro constant]] (the ratio of the number of particles, ''N'', which is unitless, to the amount of substance, ''n'', in units of moles), and ''e'' is the [[elementary charge]] or the magnitude of the charge of an electron. This relation holds because the amount of charge of a mole of electrons is equal to the amount of charge in ''one'' electron multiplied by the number of electrons in a mole.}}

The FEM is a particular [[numerical analysis|numerical method]] for solving [[partial differential equations]] in two or three space variables (i.e., some [[boundary value problem]]s). To solve a problem, the FEM subdivides a large system into smaller, simpler parts that are called finite elements. This is achieved by a particular space [[discretization]] in the space dimensions, which is implemented by the construction of a [[types of mesh|mesh]] of the object: the numerical domain for the solution, which has a finite number of points.
The finite element method formulation of a boundary value problem finally results in a system of [[algebraic equation]]s. The method approximates the unknown function over the domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Use of the term by T.E. Stern (1928) was misquoted as "Newton's constant of gravitation" in ''Pure Science Reviewed for Profound and Unsophisticated Students'' (1930), in what is apparently the first use of that term. Use of "Newton's constant" (without specifying "gravitation" or "gravity") is more recent, as "Newton's constant" was also
used for the [[heat transfer coefficient]] in [[Newton's law of cooling]], but has by now become quite common, e.g.
Calmet et al, ''Quantum Black Holes'' (2013), p. 93; P. de Aquino, ''Beyond Standard Model Phenomenology at the LHC'' (2013), p. 3.

The name "Cavendish gravitational constant", sometimes "Newton–Cavendish gravitational constant", appears to have been common in the 1970s to 1980s, especially in (translations from) Soviet-era Russian literature, e.g. Sagitov (1970 [1969]), ''Soviet Physics: Uspekhi'' 30 (1987), Issues 1–6, p. 342 [etc.].
"Cavendish constant" and "Cavendish gravitational constant" is also used in Charles W. Misner, Kip S. Thorne, John Archibald Wheeler, "Gravitation", (1973), 1126f.

For two pairwise interacting point particles, the gravitational potential energy &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is given by

More generally, exponentiation allows any positive [[real number]] as base to be raised to any real power, always producing a positive result, so {{math|log&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')}} for any two positive real numbers&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|b}} and&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|x}}, where&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|b}} is not equal to&amp;nbsp;{{math|1}}, is always a unique real number&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|y}}.

:&lt;math&gt; \log_b(x)=y \ &lt;/math&gt; exactly if &lt;math&gt;\ b^y=x\ &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\ x &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\ b &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\ b \ne 1&lt;/math&gt;.

{{About|tool that measures the aqueous solution conductivity|Other tool|Electrical conductivity meter}}

In electrochemistry, '''conductivity cell''' is crucial for measuring the solution's electrical conductivity. The concentration and ion mobility of solution in chemistry are related to conductivity of that solution. The conductive cells are useful for determining the ionic strength and the purity of solutions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Sandhya |first=Mrs. |title=Pharmaceutical Analysis |date=2025-05-10 |publisher=JEC Publication |isbn=9789361751585 |page=155 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Apparatus of conductivity meter.png|thumb|An apparatus of conductivity cell.]]

Conductivity cells are designed to work in variety of situations and measurement kinds. Conductivity cells come in variety of forms, including low and high conductivity cell types. In many cases the cells with cylindrical electrode typologies or parallel plate layouts are used.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Utility ==
Conductivity cell is used as a sensor or meter that detects the conductivity of the solution. The setup consist of two electrodes made of platinum or stainless steel and these electrodes are directly connected to the solution being analysed.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Ware |first=A. L. |title=A textbook of pharmaceutical analysis |publisher=Shaswant Publication |year=2024 |isbn=9789360877453 |edition=1rst |location=India |pages=166 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also used to make sure that the electrode and solution are in contact so enough that they can flawlessly conduct electricity. For accurate readings, temperature compensation is essential, since conductivity is sensitive to temperature variations. A resistance thermometer is embedded within the sample cell to detect the temperature. This reading is used to automatically adjust the measurement circuit, typically by modifying the zero level or the amplification range, so the output reflects only changes in chemical concentration and not temperature shifts.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Setup ==
In the physical setup, the cell is compact with a large electrode surface area to reduce the influence of fouling and to ensure stability. It includes insulated and grounded components to maintain measurement integrity. The entire assembly is cast or sealed to prevent leaks, especially when dealing with corrosive or radioactive solutions.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Colvin |first=D. W. |title=''An in-line conductivity meter with temperature compensation'' |journal=AEC Research and Development Report |volume=1rst |pages=8–11 |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The system is calibrated using standard solutions of known conductivity at a reference temperature. Once calibrated, the unit continuously measures conductance in-line without the need for manual sampling. The output can be fed to a recorder or control system, giving real-time feedback on concentration changes in a process stream. The mechanism for temperature compensation is driven by a potentiometric adjustment linked to the recorder, ensuring that as temperature changes are detected, they immediately adjust the baseline of the conductance reading.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

This makes the conductivity cell a practical tool for process control in chemical systems where rapid and continuous monitoring is necessary.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Types of conductivity cell ==

=== Electrodeless C cell ===
This type of conductivity cell uses electromagnetic waves to measure the conductivity of a solution, meaning it does not have any kind of electrodes that are attached to solution. It does this measurement by releasing some electromagnetic field and these electromagnetic field change based on conductivity of solution allowing the measurement.

=== Electrode based conductivity cell ===
This is a traditional kind of conductivity which uses the electrodes and measures in the setup explained above.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Understanding Conductivity Cells: Basics &amp; Applications |url=https://pharmacyinfoline.com/conductivity-cell/ |access-date=2025-05-12 |website=Pharmacy Infoline |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mathematical measurement ==

# Conductivity cell: The cell constant is a characteristic of a conductivity cell, defined by the geometry of the electrodes and the distance between them. It is calculated using the formula:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2025-03-01 |title=Conductivity Sensor Cell Constant: Comprehensive Guide to Precise Electrical Measurement - sensor.wiki |url=https://sensor.wiki/conductivity-sensor-cell-constant/ |access-date=2025-05-12 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=O'Donnell |first=Dominic |date=2017-11-29 |title=Understanding Conductivity Cell Constants {{!}} Sensorex |url=https://sensorex.com/conductivity-cell-constants/ |access-date=2025-05-12 |website=Sensorex Liquid Analysis Technology |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;K = L/A&lt;/math&gt;

    
2. Conductivity is determined by the product of the conductance and the cell constant:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Application of Conductivity |url=https://www.emerson.com/documents/automation/application-data-sheet-theory-application-of-conductivity-rosemount-en-68442.pdf |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20240601141817/https://www.emerson.com/documents/automation/application-data-sheet-theory-application-of-conductivity-rosemount-en-68442.pdf |archive-date=2024-06-01 |access-date=2025-05-12 |website=www.emerson.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Conductivity theory and measurement |url=https://iccontrols.com/wp-content/uploads/art-4-1_conductivity_theory_and_measurement.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\kappa = G * K&lt;/math&gt;              [ G= conductance and K = cell constant]

3. Conductance is the reciprocal of resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Cell Constant given Conductance and Conductivity Calculator {{!}} Calculate Cell Constant given Conductance and Conductivity |url=https://www.calculatoratoz.com/en/cell-constant-if-conductance-and-conductivity-given-calculator/Calc-18672 |access-date=2025-05-12 |website=www.calculatoratoz.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the direct measurement of the strength (or ability) of an solution to conduct electricity:

&lt;math&gt;G = 1/R&lt;/math&gt;

4. Calibration method: To determine the cell constant, a standard solution with known conductivity is used.         Measure the resistance of this solution with the conductivity cell, then calculate the cell constant&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Calibration method of conductivity cells |url=https://www.oiml.org/en/files/pdf_r/r068-e85.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;-:

&lt;math&gt;K = \kappa*R&lt;/math&gt;

      <text bytes="4433" sha1="oc0nddrivk7n2gr8vyn1yieh5cb74g4" xml:space="preserve">'''Design for inspection''' ('''DFI''') is an engineering principle that proposes that inspection methods and [[measurement instruments]] used to certify manufacturing conformity, should be considered early in the design of products. Production processes should be designed in such a way that features of the product are easy to inspect with readily available measurement instruments, and so that [[measurement uncertainty]] is considered in the tolerance that are applied. The concept can be applied in almost all engineering disciplines. DFI describes the process of designing or engineering a product in order to facilitate the measurement in order to reduce the overall costs of manufacturing and delivering products that satisfy customers.

The role of [[inspection]] in the manufacturing process is to ensure that the manufacturing process is producing components that meet the specification requirements. Inspection does not assure the quality of the product, only a robust and repeatable manufacturing process can achieve this. Therefore, inspection is often considered as an overhead although an extremely important one. Similar to [[design for manufacture]] (DFM) and [[design for assembly]] (DFA) (which seek to avoid designs which are difficult to make), the concept of DFI considers measurement capabilities at an early stage in the product development life cycle and uses knowledge of the fundamental principles of [[metrology]] to achieve cost reduction. If the inspection method and instruments are considered and selected at the design stage, the likelihood that a tolerance feature cannot be inspected or requires a specialised instrument is substantially reduced. High precision features require specialised manufacturing and metrology, these can have limited availability in the supply chain and therefore often have increased cost.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.slideshare.net/mobile/slideshow/embed_code/key/sQ8C7MKdFDeEVQ Hitchens Carl (2014) Guide to Engineering Metrology]{{Dead link|date=January 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of DFI should complement and work in collaboration with DFM and DFA. There are three key areas when considering DFI, datum selection, tolerances and accessibility, plus general metrology considerations. Getting the most from inspection techniques will help improve quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.designnews.com/document.asp?doc_id=224661 |title=Design News - Features - Inspection Should be Next Design Consideration |access-date=2016-09-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160925001417/http://www.designnews.com/document.asp?doc_id=224661 |archive-date=2016-09-25 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is still difficult for systems designers to build machines that allow finished products to be inspected easily. To do so requires an understanding of the product being manufactured and how inspection tasks can improve the quality control process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vision-systems.com/articles/print/volume-13/issue-10/technology-trends/design-for-inspection-keynotes-niweek.html|title=Design for inspection keynotes NIWeek|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspection can represent a significant percentage of an existing product's manufacturing cost. DFI may naturally be called for in redesign of a product to reduce that cost component when it is high. However, DFI will not always reduce inspection costs: it can also lead to increased rate of inspection, because more convenient or higher quality measurement may justify increasing measurements, say from a sampling rate satisfactory to support a basic level of tolerance to a higher rate (e.g. to 100%). Or DFI may make it economical for 100% inspections to measure more features or to make repeated measures of the same feature at different points within the manufacturing process. This would be justified if it would reduce internal failure costs (such as costs of rework or scrap) or external failure costs (such as customer returns) within the [[cost of quality]] framework.

As the reservoir fluids are pumped from the ground, changes in temperature, pressure and chemical composition shift the equilibria and cause precipitation and deposition of sparingly soluble salts that build up over time with the potential of blocking vital assets in the oil production setups.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Formation, removal, and inhibition of inorganic scale in the oilfield environment|last=Wayne W Frenier, Murtaza Ziauddin, N.

== Types of scales ==
Two main classifications of scales are known; inorganic and organic scales and the two types are mutually inclusive, occurring simultaneously in the same system, referred to as mixed scale.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Mixed scales may result in highly complex structured scales that are difficult to treat. Such scales require aggressive, severe and sometimes costly remediation techniques.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Paraffin wax]], [[asphaltene]]s and [[Clathrate hydrate|gas hydrates]] are the most often encountered organic scales in the oil industry. This article focuses on the simplest and common form of scales encountered; inorganic scales.

=== Inorganic scale ===
Inorganic scales refer to [[Mineral|mineral deposits]] that occur when the formation water mixes with different [[brine]]s such as injection water. The mixing changes causes reaction between incompatible ions and changes the thermodynamic and equilibrium state of the reservoir fluids. [[Supersaturation]] and subsequent deposition of the inorganic salts occur. The most common types of inorganic scales known to the oil/gas industry are [[Carbonate minerals|carbonates]] and [[Sulfate minerals|sulfates]]; [[Sulfide minerals|sulfides]] and [[Chlorite group|chlorites]] are often encountered.

While the solubility of most inorganic salts (NaCl, KCl, ...) increases with temperature (endothermic dissolution reaction), some inorganic salts such as calcium carbonate and calcium sulfate have also a [[Solubility#Temperature|retrograde solubility]], i.e., their solubility decreases with temperature. In the case of calcium carbonate, it is due to the degassing of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; whose solubility decreases with temperature as is the case for most of the gases (exothermic dissolution reaction in water). In calcium sulfate, the reason is that the dissolution reaction of calcium sulfate itself is exothermic and therefore is favored when the temperature decreases (then, the dissolution heat is more easily evacuated; see [[Le Chatelier's principle]]). In other terms, the solubility of calcium carbonate and calcium sulfate increases at low temperature and decreases at high temperature, as it is also the case for [[calcium hydroxide]] ([[portlandite]]), often cited as a didactic case study to explain the reason of retrograde solubility.

=== Calcium carbonate scale ===
Water, noted for its high solvation power can dissolve certain gases such as carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to form aqueous CO&lt;sub&gt;2(aq)&lt;/sub&gt;. Under the right conditions of temperature and/or pressure, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and CO&lt;sub&gt;2(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; molecules react to yield carbonic acid (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) whose solubility increases at low temperature and high pressure.  The slightest changes in pressure and temperature dissolves H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; in water according to equation (3) to form hydronium and bicarbonate (HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt;) ions.
# CO&lt;sub&gt;2(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;(l)&lt;/sub&gt; ↔ H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3(aq)&lt;/sub&gt;
# H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; ↔  H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; + HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt;
# 2 HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; ↔ CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;(l)&lt;/sub&gt; + CO&lt;sub&gt;2(g)&lt;/sub&gt;
# Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; + CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; ↔ CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3(s)&lt;/sub&gt;

The two reactions (2) and (4) describe the equilibrium between bicarbonate ions (HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), which are highly soluble in water and calcium carbonate (CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) salt. According to [[Le Chatelier's principle]], drilling operations and extraction of the oil from the well bore decreases the pressure of the formation and the equilibrium shifts to the right (3) to increase the production of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to offset the change in pressure. After years of oil production, wells may experience significant pressure drops resulting in large CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; deposits as the equilibrium shifts to offset the pressure changes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Sulfate scales ===
Sulfates of Group (II) metal ions (M&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;), generally decrease in solubility down the group. The most difficult scales to remove are those of Barium sulfate because of its high insolubility forming very hard scale deposits. A general representation of the reaction is summarized in reaction:

5. M&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; + SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; → MSO&lt;sub&gt;4(s)&lt;/sub&gt;

Sulfate scale usually forms when formation water and injected seawater mix together.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The relationship between these and the degree of supersaturation is crucial in estimating the amount of sulfate salts that will precipitate in the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Collins|first=I.R.|title=International Symposium on Oilfield Scale |date=2002-01-01|chapter=A New Model for Mineral Scale Adhesion|language=en|publisher=Society of Petroleum Engineers|doi=10.2118/74655-ms|isbn=9781555639426}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seawater has a high concentration of sulfate ions and mixing with formation water with many Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and other M&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions in the formation water. Severe problems with sulfate scale are common in reservoirs where seawater has been injected to enhance oil recovery.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Due to its relatively high solubility in water, Calcium sulfate is the easiest sulfate scale to remove chemically as compared to strontium and barium sulfate.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Scale crystals are initially dispersed in production systems until accumulation of stable crystals of insoluble sulfates and scale growth occur at nucleation centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crabtree, M., Eslinger, D., Fletcher, P., Miller, M., Johnson, A., &amp; King, G.|year=1999|title=Fighting Scale- prevention and removal|journal=Oilfield Review|volume=11 |issue=3|pages=30–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Uneven pipeline surfaces and production equipment such as pumps and valves cause rapid scale growth to levels that can block pipelines.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The scaling-tendency of an oil-well can be predicted based on the prevailing conditions such as pH, temperature, pressure, ionic strength and the mole fraction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the vapor and aqueous phases.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Oddo|first1=J.E.|last2=Tomson|first2=M.B.|date=1994-02-01|title=Why Scale Forms in the Oil Field and Methods To Predict It|journal=SPE Production &amp; Facilities|language=en|volume=9|issue=1|pages=47–54|doi=10.2118/21710-pa|issn=1064-668X}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance the saturation index for CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; scale is calculated using the formula;

F&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;= {[Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;][CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;]}/K&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;

Where F&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; is the scale saturation ratio, defined as the ratio of the activity product to the solubility product of the salt. Activity is defined as the product of the activity coefficients and the concentrations of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; ions. The ionic strength is a measure of the concentration of the dissociated ions dissolved in water also called as “total dissolved solids” (TDS).&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Scale remediation ==
Different oilfield scale remediation techniques are known but majority are based on three basic themes:
# Sulfate ion sequestering from sea injection waters
# Chemical or mechanical Scale removal/dissolution
# Application of Scale Inhibitors (SIs) for scale prevention
The first two methods may be used for short-term treatment and effective for mild-scaling conditions,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; however, continuous injection or chemical scale squeeze treatment with SIs have been proven over the years to be the most efficient and cost-effective preventative technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Laing|first1=N.|last2=Graham|first2=G.M.|last3=Dyer|first3=S.J.|chapter=Barium Sulphate Inhibition in Subsea Systems – the Impact of Cold Seabed Temperatures on the Performance of Generically Different Scale Inhibitor Species |date=2003-01-01|title=International Symposium on Oilfield Chemistry|language=en|publisher=Society of Petroleum Engineers|doi=10.2118/80229-ms|isbn=9781555639556}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scale inhibitors ===
[[File:DTPMP.png|thumb|Chemical Structure of Diethylenetriaminepenta(methylene-phosphonic acid)]]
Scale inhibitors are specialty chemicals that are added to oil production systems to delay, reduce and/or prevent scale deposition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[acrylic acid]] polymers, [[maleic acid]] polymers and [[phosphonate]]s have been used extensively for scale treatment in water systems due to their excellent solubility, thermal stability and dosage efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Amjad|first1=Zahid|last2=Koutsoukos|first2=Petros G.|date=2014-02-17|title=Evaluation of maleic acid based polymers as scale inhibitors and dispersants for industrial water applications|journal=Desalination|volume=335|issue=1|pages=55–63|doi=10.1016/j.desal.2013.12.012|bibcode=2014Desal.335...55A }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Shakkthivel|first1=P.|last2=Vasudevan|first2=T.|date=2006-10-02|title=Acrylic acid-diphenylamine sulphonic acid copolymer threshold inhibitor for sulphate and carbonate scales in cooling water systems|journal=Desalination|volume=197|issue=1|pages=179–189|doi=10.1016/j.desal.2005.12.023|bibcode=2006Desal.197..179S }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the water treatment industry, the major classes of SIs have inorganic phosphate, organophosphorous and organic polymer backbones and common examples are PBTC (phosphonobutane-1,2,4-tricarboxylic acid), [[ATMP]] (amino-trimethylene phosphonic acid) and HEDP (1-hydroxyethylidene-1,1-diphosphonic acid), [[polyacrylic acid]] (PAA), phosphinopolyacrylates (such as PPCA), polymaleic acids (PMA), [[maleic acid]] terpolymers (MAT), [[sulfonic acid]] copolymers, such as SPOCA (sulfonated phosphonocarboxylic acid), polyvinyl sulfonates. Two common oilfield mineral SIs are Poly-Phosphono Carboxylic acid (PPCA) and Diethylenetriamine- penta (methylene phosphonic acid) ([[DTPMP]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Bezemer|first1=Cornelis|last2=Bauer|first2=Karl A.|date=1969-04-01|title=Prevention of Carbonate Scale Deposition: A Well-Packing Technique with Controlled Solubility Phosphates|journal=Journal of Petroleum Technology|language=en|volume=21|issue=4|pages=505–514|doi=10.2118/2176-pa|issn=0149-2136|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, to bind positively charged ions in the water, anions must be present in the inhibitor molecular backbone structure and vice versa. Group (II) metal ions are commonly sequestered by SIs with the following functionalities;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

- Phosphonate ions (-PO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)

'''-''' Phosphate ions (-OPO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)

- Phosphonate ions (-PO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)

- Sulphonate ions (-SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)

- Carboxylate ions (-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)

A SI with a combination of two or more of these functional groups is more efficient in managing scale problems. Usually the sodium salts of the carboxylic derivatives are synthesized as the anionic derivatives and are known to be the most effective due to their high solubilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Interactions of these functional groups tend to prevent the crystal growth sites using dissociated or un-dissociated groups. The dissociation state is determined by the pH of the system, hence knowledge of the pKa values of the chemicals are important for different pH environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Graham|first=GM Boak, LS Sorbie, KS|year=2003|title=The influence of formation calcium and magnesium on the effectiveness of generically different barium sulphate oilfield scale inhibitors|journal=Soc Petroleum Eng|volume=18|pages=28–44|via=Science Citation Index}}&lt;/ref&gt; Again, the inhibition efficiency of the SI depends on its compatibility with other production chemicals such as corrosion inhibitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Lawless|first1=T.A.|last2=Bourne|first2=H.M.|last3=Bolton|first3=J.R.|chapter=Examining the Potential for Corrosion Inhibitor and Scale Inhibitor Compatibility in a Multifunctional Squeeze Strategy |date=1993-01-01|title=SPE International Symposium on Oilfield Chemistry|language=en|publisher=Society of Petroleum Engineers|doi=10.2118/25167-ms|isbn=9781555634926}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental considerations ==
Generally, the environmental impacts of SIs are complicated further by combination of other chemicals applied through exploratory, drilling, well-completion and start-up operations. Produced fluids, and other wastes from oil and gas operations with high content of different toxic compounds are hazardous and harmful to human health, water supplies, marine and freshwater organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.offshore-environment.com/drillwastestream.html|title=Drilling Waste Streams from Offshore Oil and Gas Installations|website=www.offshore-environment.com|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Oilfield water technology.|last=Davies|first=Michael; P.

Efforts to develop more [[environmentally friendly]] SIs have been made since the late 1990s and an increasing number of such SIs are becoming commercially available.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Recent environmental awareness over the past 15 years has resulted in the production and application of more environmentally friendly SIs, otherwise called 'Green Scale Inhibitors' (GSI).&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Boak|first1=Lorraine S.|last2=Sorbie|first2=Ken|date=2010-11-01|title=New Developments in the Analysis of Scale Inhibitors|journal=SPE Production &amp; Operations|language=en|volume=25|issue=4|pages=533–544|doi=10.2118/130401-pa|issn=1930-1855}}&lt;/ref&gt; These GSIs are designed to have reduced bio-accumulating and high [[biodegradability]] properties and therefore reduce pollution of the waters around oil production systems.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; [[Phosphate ester]] SIs, commonly employed for treating calcium carbonate scales are known to be environmentally friendly but poor inhibition efficiency.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Jordan|first1=Myles M.|last2=Sorhaug|first2=Eyvind|last3=Marlow|first3=David|date=2012-11-01|title=Red vs. Green Scale Inhibitors for Extending Squeeze life--A Case Study From the North Sea, Norwegian Sector--Part II|journal=SPE Production &amp; Operations|language=en|volume=27|issue=4|pages=404–413|doi=10.2118/140752-pa|issn=1930-1855}}&lt;/ref&gt; Release of SIs containing Nitrogen and Phosphorus distorts the natural equilibrium of the immediate water body with adverse effects on aquatic life.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Another modern alternative to SI use for environmental protection is the development of materials or coatings that intrinsically resist formation of inorganic scale to begin with. A variety of strategies can be used to accomplish this aim, including engineering of wettability properties and engineering of epitaxial properties to prevent mineral growth or to make minerals easier to remove following growth. Recent work has demonstrated that some classes of hydrophobic and superhydrophobic surfaces can cause self-ejection of scale grown during evaporation &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=McBride|first1=Samantha|last2=Lake|first2=John|last3=Varanasi|first3=Kripa|date=2023-04-07|title=Self-ejection of salts and other foulants from superhydrophobic surfaces to enable sustainable anti-fouling|journal=The Journal of Chemical Physics|volume=158|issue=13 |pages=134721 |doi=10.1063/5.0142428|pmid=37031132 |doi-access=free|bibcode=2023JChPh.158m4721M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Mechanical engineering]]''' is a discipline centered around the concept of using [[Mechanical advantage|force multipliers]], moving components, and [[machine]]s. It utilizes knowledge of [[mathematics]], [[physics]], [[materials science]]s, and engineering technologies. It is one of the oldest and broadest of the [[List of engineering branches|engineering disciplines]].

== Dawn of civilization to early Antiquity ==&lt;!-- Obviously, We can't just use "The Ancient Engineers" for the entire early MechE History section. --&gt;

Engineering arose in early civilization as a general discipline for the creation of large scale structures such as irrigation, architecture, and military projects.

The [[Assyria]]ns were notable in their use of metallurgy and incorporation of iron weapons. Many of their advancements were in military equipment. They were not the first to develop them, but did make advancements on the wheel and the chariot. They made use of pivot-able axles on their wagons, allowing easy turning. They were also one of the first armies to use the move-able siege tower and battering ram.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The application of mechanical engineering can be seen in the archives of various ancient societies. The [[pulley]] appeared in Mesopotamia in 1,500 BC, improving water transportation. German Archaeologist [[Robert Koldewey]] found that the [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon|Hanging Gardens]] likely used a mechanical pump powered by these pulleys to transport water to the roof gardens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The excavations at Babylon|last=Koldewey|first=Robert|publisher=Macmillan and Co.|year=1914|isbn=9781298040022|location=London|pages=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mesopotamians would advance even further by replacing "the substitution of continuous for intermittent motion, and the rotary for back-and-forth motion" by 1,200 BC.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In [[Ancient Egypt]], the [[Archimedes' screw|screw pump]] is another example of the use of engineering to boost efficiency of water transportation. Although the Early Egyptians built colossal structures such as the pyramids, they did not develop pulleys for the lifting of heavy stone, and used the wheel very little.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The earliest practical [[water-power]]ed machines, the [[water wheel]] and [[watermill]], first appeared in the [[Persian Empire]], in what are now Iraq and Iran, by the early 4th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Selin |first1=Helaine |title=Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Westen Cultures |date=2013 |publisher=[[Springer Science &amp; Business Media]] |isbn=9789401714167 |page=282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ancient Greece]], [[Archimedes]] (287–212 BC) developed several key theories in the field of mechanical engineering including [[mechanical advantage]], the [[Law of the lever|Law of the Lever]], and his name sake, [[Archimedes law|Archimedes’ law]]. In [[Ptolematic Egypt]], the [[Musaeum|Museum of Alexandria]] developed crane pulleys with [[block and tackle]]s to lift stones. These cranes were powered with human tread wheels and were based on earlier Mesopotamian water-pulley systems.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Greeks would later develop mechanical artillery independently of the Chinese. The first of these would fire darts, but advancements allowed for stone to be tossed at enemy fortifications or formations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Late Antiquity to early Middle Ages ==
In [[Roman Egypt]], [[Hero of Alexandria|Heron of Alexandria]] (c. 10–70 AD) created the first [[steam-powered]] device, the [[Aeolipile]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/263417/Heron-of-Alexandria "Heron of Alexandria"]. Encyclopædia Britannica 2010 - Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Accessed: 9 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The first of its kind, it did not have the capability to move or power anything but its own rotation.

In [[History of China#Han Dynasty|China]], [[Zhang Heng]] (78–139 AD) improved a [[water clock]] and invented a [[seismometer]]. [[Ma Jun (mechanical engineer)|Ma Jun]] (200–265 AD) invented a chariot with [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]] gears.

[[Leo the Mathematician|Leo the Philosopher]] is noted to have worked on a signal system using clocks in the Byzantine Empire in 850, connecting [[Constantinople]] with the Cilician Frontier and was a continuation of the complex city clocks in Eastern Rome. These grand machines diffused into the Arabian Empire under [[Harun al-Rashid]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Technology in Trainsition A.D. 300-650|last=Lavan|first=Luke|last2=Zanini|first2=Enrico|last3=Sarantis|first3=Alexander|publisher=|year=2007|isbn=9789004165496|location=Boston|pages=373–374}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another grand mechanical device was the [[Organ (instrument)|Organ]], which was reintroduced in 757 when [[Constantine V]] gifted one to [[Pepin the Short|Pepin the short]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

With the exception of a few machines, engineering and science stagnated in the West due to the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|collapse of the Roman Empire]] during late antiquity.

== Middle Ages ==
During the [[Islamic Golden Age]] (7th to 15th century), [[Inventions in medieval Islam|Muslim inventors]] made remarkable contributions in the field of mechanical technology. [[Al-Jazari]], who was one of them, wrote his famous ''Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices'' in 1206 and presented many mechanical designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.middleeasteye.net/discover/medieval-robots-turkey-how-science-genius-al-jazari-brought-mechanical-marvels-istanbul|title=Medieval robots: How al-Jazari's mechanical marvels have been resurrected in Istanbul|website=Middle East Eye|language=en|access-date=2019-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Jazari is also the first known person to create devices such as the [[crankshaft]] and [[camshaft]], which now form the basics of many mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Jazarí.

The medieval Chinese horologist and engineer [[Su Song]] (1020–1101 AD) incorporated an [[escapement]] mechanism into his [[astronomical]] [[clock tower]] two centuries before escapement devices were found in medieval European clocks and also invented the world's first known endless power-transmitting [[chain drive]].&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Joseph (1986). ''Science and Civilization in China: Volume 4''. Taipei: Caves Books, Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Middle Ages saw the wide spread adoption of machines to aid in labor. The many rivers of England and northern Europe allowed the power of moving water to be utilized. The [[Watermill|water-mill]] became instrumental in the production of many goods such as food, fabric, leathers, and papers. These machines used were some of the first to use cogs and gears, which greatly increased the mills productivity. The [[camshaft]] allowed rotational force to be converted into directional force. Less significantly, tides of bodies of water were also harnessed.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Medieval Machine : The Industrial Revolution of the Middle Ages|last=Gimpel|first=Jean|publisher=|year=1976|isbn=9780030146367|location=|pages=1–24, 66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wind-power later became the new source of energy in Europe, supplementing the water mill. This advancement moved out of Europe into the Middle East during the Crusades.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Metallurgy advanced by a large degree during the Middle Ages, with higher quality iron allowing for more sturdy constructions and designs. Mills and mechanical power provided a consistent supply of trip-hammer strikes and air from the bellows.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
[[File:Leonardo da Vinci helicopter and lifting wing.jpg|thumb|Da Vinci's flying machine concepts]]

== European Renaissance ==
During the 17th century, important breakthroughs in the foundations of mechanical engineering occurred in [[England]].  Sir [[Isaac Newton]] formulated [[Newton's Laws of Motion]] and developed [[Calculus]], the mathematical basis of physics. Newton was reluctant to publish his works for years, but he was finally persuaded to do so by his colleagues, such as Sir [[Edmond Halley]], much to the benefit of all mankind. [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] is also credited with creating Calculus during this time period.

[[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo Da Vinci]] was a notable engineer, designing and studying many mechanical systems that were focused around transportation and warfare&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.asme.org/topics-resources/content/leonardo-da-vinci|title=Leonardo Da Vinci|website=www.asme.org|language=en|access-date=2019-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; His designs would later be compared to early aircraft design.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://airandspace.si.edu/stories/editorial/leonardo-da-vinci-and-flight|title=Leonardo da Vinci and Flight|date=2013-08-22|website=National Air and Space Museum|language=en|access-date=2019-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although wind power provided a source of energy away from riverside estate and saw massive improvements in its harnessing, it could not replace the consistent and strong power of the watermill. Water would remain the primary source of power of pre-industrial urban industry through the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Engines Of The Imagination: Renaissance Culture And The Rise Of The Machine|last=Sawday|first=Jonathan|publisher=|year=2007|isbn=9780203696156|location=|pages=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Industrial Revolution ==
{{See also|History of the steam engine}}

At the end of the Renaissance, scientists and engineers were beginning to experiment with steam power. Most of the early apparatuses faced problems of low horsepower, inefficiency, or danger. The need arose for an effective and economical power source because of the flooding of deep-mines in [[England]], which could not be pumped out using alternative methods. The first working design was [[Thomas Savery|Thomas Savory]]'s 1698 patent. He continuously worked on improving and marketing the invention across England. At the same time, others were working on improvements to Savory's design, which did not transfer heat effectively.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A history of the growth of the steam engine|last=Thurston|first=|publisher=|year=1939|isbn=|location=New York|pages=35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Newcomen]] would take all the advancements of the engineers and develop the [[Newcomen atmospheric engine|Newcomen Atmospheric Engine]]. This new design would greatly reduce heat loss, move water directly from the engine, and allow variety of proportions to be built in.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The [[Industrial Revolution]] brought steam powered factories utilizing mechanical engineering concepts. These advances allowed an incredible increase in production scale, numbers, and efficiency.

During the 19th century, material sciences advances had begun to allow implementation of steam engines into [[Steam locomotive|Steam Locomotives]] and [[Steamship|Steam-Powered Ships]], quickly increasing the speed at which people and goods could move across the world. The reason for these advances were the [[machine tool]]s were developed in England, [[Germany]], and [[Scotland]]. These allowed mechanical engineering to develop as a separate field within engineering. They brought with them manufacturing machines and the engines to power them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9105842/engineering Engineering] – Encyclopædia Britannica, accessed 6 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

At the near end of the Industrial Revolution, [[internal combustion engine]] technology brought with it the [[Airplane|piston airplane]] and [[automobile]]. [[Aerospace engineering|Aerospace Engineering]] would develop in the early 20th century as a offshoot of mechanical engineering, eventually incorporating rocketry.

Coal was replaced by [[Petroleum|oil]] based derivatives for many applications.

== Modern Age ==
With the advents of computers in the 20th century, more precise design and manufacturing methods were available to engineers. Automated and Computerized manufacturing allowed many new fields to emerge from Mechanical Engineering such as [[Industrial engineering|Industrial Engineering]]. Although a majority of automobiles remain to be gas powered, electric vehicles have risen as a feasible alternative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/30/electric-vehicles-will-grow-from-3-million-to-125-million-by-2030-iea.html|title=Electric vehicles will grow from 3 million to 125 million by 2030, International Energy Agency forecasts|last=DiChristopher|first=Tom|date=2018-05-30|website=CNBC|language=en|access-date=2019-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the increased complexity of engineering projects, many disciplines of engineer collaborate and specialize in [[Mechanical Engineering#Subdisciplines|sub fields]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://zjui.intl.zju.edu.cn/en/content/984|title=Mechanical Engineering {{!}} ZJU-UIUC Institute|website=zjui.intl.zju.edu.cn|access-date=2019-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of these collaborations is the field of [[robotics]], in which [[Electrical engineering|electrical engineers]], [[Computer engineering|computer engineers]], and mechanical engineers can specialize in and work together.

=== Professional associations ===
The first British professional society of mechanical engineers was formed in 1847 [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]], thirty years after the civil engineers formed the first such professional society [[Institution of Civil Engineers]].&lt;ref&gt;R.A. Buchanan. The [[Economy|Economic]] History Review, New Series, Vol. 38, No. 1 (Feb. 1985), pp. 42–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] (ASME) was formed in 1880, becoming the third such professional engineering society, after the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]] (1852) and the [[American Institute of Mining Engineers]] (1871).&lt;ref&gt;[http://anniversary.asme.org/history.shtml ASME history] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110223145123/http://anniversary.asme.org/history.shtml|date=23 February 2011}}, accessed 6 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education ===
The first schools in the United States to offer a mechanical engineering education were the [[United States Military Academy]] in 1817, an institution now known as [[Norwich University]] in 1819, and [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] in 1825. Education in mechanical engineering has historically been based on a strong foundation in mathematics and science.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/65/en/engineer.html The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. 2001, engineering], accessed 6 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, many governments began [[Regulation and licensure in engineering|regulating both the title of engineer and the practice of engineering]], requiring a degree from an accredited university and to past a qualifying test.

{{about|engineering defects in general|defects in computer software|software bug|defects in computer hardware|hardware bug}}
In engineering, a '''bug''' is a [[design]] defect in an [[engineered]] [[system]] that causes an undesired result.

Although used exclusively to describe a technical issue, ''bug'' is a non-technical term; applicable without technical understanding of the system.

The term ''bug'' applies exclusively to a system that is (human) designed; not to a natural system; and that the issue is within the influence of human control. For example, humans have faults but not bugs, and a server crash due to natural disaster is not a bug.

In addition to or instead of ''defect'', some use: error, flaw or [[Fault (technology)|fault]].

Engineered systems is a broad classification encompassing but not limited to: [[software]], [[computer hardware]], [[electronics]], [[circuitry]] and [[machinery]].

The undesirable result can be classified and described ''many'' ways including: intermittent, transient, [[glitch]], [[Crash (computing)|crash]] or [[freeze (computing)|hang]].

Since desirability is subjective, what is considered undesirable to one may be considered desirable to another; even a useful feature.

== History ==
The Middle English word ''[[wikt:bugge#Noun|bugge]]'' is the basis for the terms ''[[wikt:bugbear#Noun|bugbear]]'' and ''[[wikt:bug-a-boo#Noun|bugaboo]]'' as terms used for a monster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.computerworld.com/article/2515435/app-development/moth-in-the-machine--debugging-the-origins-of--bug-.html |title= Moth in the machine: Debugging the origins of 'bug' |author= Computerworld staff |date= September 3, 2011 |work= Computerworld |url-status= live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150825040938/http://www.computerworld.com/article/2515435/app-development/moth-in-the-machine--debugging-the-origins-of--bug-.html |archivedate= August 25, 2015 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''bug'' to describe a defect has been engineering jargon since at least as far back as the 1870s {{endash}} long before electronic computers and computer software. For instance, [[Thomas Edison]] wrote the following words in a letter to an associate in 1878:

{{blockquote|It has been just so in all of my inventions. The first step is an intuition, and comes with a burst, then difficulties arise—this thing gives out and [it is] then that "Bugs"—as such little faults and difficulties are called—show themselves and months of intense watching, study and labor are requisite before commercial success or failure is certainly reached.&lt;ref name="Hughes1989"&gt;Edison to Puskas, 13 November 1878, Edison papers, Edison National Laboratory, U.S. National Park Service, West Orange, N.J., cited in  {{cite book |first= Thomas Parke |last=Hughes |title= American Genesis: A Century of Invention and Technological Enthusiasm, 1870-1970 |url= {{google books |plainurl=y |id=0r-ml88EynYC |page=75}} |year=1989 |publisher= Penguin Books |isbn= 978-0-14-009741-2 |page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a [[comic strip]] printed in a 1924 [[telephone]] industry journal, a naive character hears that a man has a job as a "bug hunter" and gives a gift of a [[backscratcher]].  The man replies "don't you know that a 'bug hunter' is just a [[nickname]] for a [[repairman]]?"&lt;ref&gt;Cy Meyn, Hattie the Hello Girl, [http://bh.hallikainen.org/thg/monitor/Monitor_1924-01.pdf The Mountain States Monitor] Vol. XIX, No. 1 (Jan, 1924), Mountain States Telephone and Telegraph Co.; page 34, bottom.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Baffle Ball]], the first mechanical [[pinball]] game, was advertised as being "free of bugs" in 1931.&lt;ref name="Baffle Ball"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ipdb.org/machine.cgi?gid=129 |title= Baffle Ball |publisher= Internet Pinball Database |quote=(See image of advertisement in reference entry)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Problems with military gear during [[World War II]] were referred to as bugs (or [[glitch]]es).&lt;ref name="life1942062925"&gt;{{cite magazine |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=KlAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;q=life%20magazine%20june%2029%201942&amp;pg=PA25 |title= Modern Aircraft Carriers are Result of 20 Years of Smart Experimentation |magazine= Life |date= June 29, 1942 |accessdate= November 17, 2011 |page= 25 |url-status= live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130604220016/http://books.google.com/books?id=KlAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA25#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true |archivedate= June 4, 2013 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 1940 film, ''[[Flight Command]]'', a defect in a piece of direction-finding gear is called a ''bug''.

In a book published in 1942, [[Louise Dickinson Rich]], speaking of a powered [[ice cutting]] machine, said, "Ice sawing was suspended until the creator could be brought in to take the bugs out of his darling."&lt;ref name="oclc_405243"&gt;{{Citation |last= Dickinson Rich |first= Louise |year= 1942 |title= We Took to the Woods |page= 93 |publisher= JB Lippincott Co |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=PT0zAQAAIAAJ |lccn= 42024308 |oclc= 405243 |postscript= . |url-status= live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170316164959/https://books.google.com/books?id=PT0zAQAAIAAJ |archivedate= March 16, 2017 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Isaac Asimov]] used the term ''bug'' to relate to issues with a robot in his short story "[[Catch That Rabbit]]", published in 1944.

[[File:First Computer Bug, 1945.jpg|thumbnail|250px|A page from the [[Harvard Mark II]] electromechanical computer's log, featuring a dead moth that was removed from the device]]
Computer pioneer and rear admiral, [[Grace Hopper]], popularized a story about a [[moth]] that caused a problem in an early [[electromechanical]] computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=FCAT NRT Test |publisher=Harcourt |date=March 18, 2008 |title-link=Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test }}&lt;/ref&gt; While Hopper was working on the [[Harvard Mark II|Mark II]] and [[Harvard Mark III|Mark III]] as Harvard faculty in about 1947, operators traced an error in the Mark II to a moth trapped in a relay. The moth was removed from the mechanism and taped in a log book with the note "First actual case of bug being found."
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Log Book With Computer Bug |url=https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/nmah_334663 |access-date=2024-08-16 |website=americanhistory.si.edu |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Reportedly, the operators, including William "Bill" Burke, later of the [[Naval Weapons Laboratory]], [[Dahlgren, Virginia]], &lt;ref&gt;IEEE Annals of the History of Computing, Vol 22 Issue 1, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; were familiar with the engineering term and probably making a [[word play|joke]] by conflating the two meanings of bug (biological and defect).
Although probably a joke, the story indicates that the term was commonly used in the computer field at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=James S.

The related term ''[[debug]]'' also appears to predate its usage in computing: the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''{{'}}s etymology of the word contains an attestation from 1945, in the context of aircraft engines.&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of the Royal Aeronautical Society''. 49, 183/2, 1945 "It ranged ... through the stage of type test and flight test and 'debugging' ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

=="It's not a bug, it's a feature"==
Since ''bug'' implies undesirable behavior, calling a behavior a bug is subjective. Behavior which is considered a bug by some may be considered a useful feature by others, hence a common phrase is "It's not a bug, it's a feature" (INABIAF).&lt;ref name=wired&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.wired.com/story/its-not-a-bug-its-a-feature/|title='IT'S NOT A BUG, IT'S A FEATURE.' TRITE—OR JUST RIGHT?|magazine=Wired|author=Nicholas Carr}}&lt;/ref&gt; This quip is recorded in [[The Jargon File]] dating to 1975 but dates to 1971 when [[PDP-8]] programmer Sandra Lee Harris at [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) made the distinction between issues to be fixed in the code for DEC's [[FOCAL (programming language)|FOCAL]] interpreter and those to be documented or clarified in the user manual.&lt;ref name=focalmanual&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.bitsavers.org/www.computer.museum.uq.edu.au/pdf/DEC-08-AJAB-D%20PDP-8-I%20FOCAL%20Programming%20Manual.pdf|title=FOCAL Programming Manual for PDP-8, PDP-8/S, PDP-8/I, LAB-8, LINC-8|publisher=Digital Equipment Corporation|id=DEC-08-AJAB-D|year=1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such behavior might be explicitly communicated to users, or might remain an [[undocumented feature]].

The dissolution rate of silicon is locally enhanced due to silver nanoparticles initially deposited at the surface. Eventually the silver nanoparticles "sink" into the wafer leaving behind columnar pores.]]

'''Metal Assisted Chemical Etching''' (also known as MACE) is the process of wet chemical [[etching]] of [[semiconductors]] (mainly [[silicon]]) with the use of a [[metal]] [[catalyst]], usually deposited on the surface of a [[semiconductor]] in the form of a thin film or [[nanoparticle]]s. The semiconductor, covered with the metal, is then immersed in an etching solution containing an [[oxidizing agent]] and [[hydrofluoric acid]]. The metal on the surface catalyzes the reduction of the oxidizing agent and therefore in turn also the dissolution of silicon. In the majority of the conducted research this phenomenon of increased dissolution rate is also spatially confined, such that it is increased in close proximity to a metal particle at the surface. Eventually this leads to the formation of straight pores that are etched into the semiconductor (see figure to the right). This means that a pre-defined pattern of the metal on the surface can be directly transferred to a semiconductor substrate.&lt;ref name=geyer&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Huang |first1=Zhipeng |last2=Geyer |first2=Nadine |last3=Werner |first3=Peter |last4=de Boor |first4=Johannes |last5=Gösele |first5=Ulrich |title=Metal-Assisted Chemical Etching of Silicon: A Review: In memory of Prof. Ulrich Gösele |journal=Advanced Materials |date=11 January 2011 |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=285–308 |doi=10.1002/adma.201001784|pmid=20859941 |s2cid=205237664 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of development ==
MACE is a relatively new technology in semiconductor engineering and therefore it has yet to be a process that is used in industry. The first attempts of MACE consisted of a silicon wafer that was partially covered with aluminum and then immersed in an etching solution.&lt;ref name=dimova&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dimova-Malinovska |first1=D |last2=Sendova-Vassileva |first2=M |last3=Tzenov |first3=N |last4=Kamenova |first4=M |title=Preparation of thin porous silicon layers by stain etching |journal=Thin Solid Films |date=April 1997 |volume=297 |issue=1–2 |pages=9–12 |doi=10.1016/S0040-6090(96)09434-5|bibcode=1997TSF...297....9D }}&lt;/ref&gt; This material combination led to an increased etching rate compared to bare silicon. Often this very first attempt is also called galvanic etching instead of metal assisted chemical etching.{{cn|date=October 2023}}

Further research showed that a thin film of a noble metal deposited on a silicon wafer's surface can also locally increase the etching rate. In particular, it was observed that noble metal particles sink down into the material when the sample is immersed in an etching solution containing an oxidizing agent and [[hydrofluoric acid]] (see image in the introduction).&lt;ref name=li&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Li |first1=X. |last2=Bohn |first2=P.

== Theory ==
[[File:Mace mechanism.png|thumb|Depiction of the mechanism of MACE: The reduction of an oxidizing agent (in this case H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is catalyzed at the surface of a noble metal nanoparticle (in this case gold). Because of this, holes (h&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) are injected into the valence band of the silicon substrate. These holes weaken chemical bonds at the silicon/etching solution interface and thus dissolution of the substrate with HF takes place.]]
Some elements of MACE are commonly accepted in the scientific community, while others are still under debate.&lt;ref name=geyer/&gt; There is agreement that the reduction of the oxidizing agent is catalyzed by the noble metal particle (see figure to the left). This means that the metal particle has a surplus of positive charge which is eventually transferred to the silicon substrate. Each of the positive charges in the substrate can be identified as a hole (h&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) in the [[valence band]] of the substrate, or in more chemical terms it may be interpreted as a weakened Si-Si bond due to the removal of an electron. 
The weakened bonds can be attacked by a [[Nucleophile|nucleophilic species]] such as HF or H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, which in turn leads to the dissolution of the silicon substrate in close proximity to the noble metal particle. {{Citation needed|date=October 2023}}

From a thermodynamic point of view, the MACE process is possible because the [[redox potential]] of the redox couple corresponding to the used oxidizing agents ([[hydrogen peroxide]] or [[potassium permanganate]]) are below the valence band edge at the electrochemical energy scale. Equivalently, one could say that the [[electrochemical potential]] of the [[electron]] in the etching solution (due to the presence of oxidizing agent) is lower than the electrochemical potential of the electron in the substrate, hence electrons are removed from the silicon. In the end, this accumulation of positive charge leads to the dissolution of the substrate by hydrofluoric acid.&lt;ref name=geyer/&gt;

MACE consists of multiple individual reactions. At the metal particle, the oxidizing agent is reduced. In the case of hydrogen peroxide this can be written down as follows:

:{{chem2 | H2O2 + 2 H+ -&gt; 2 H2O + 2 h+ }}

The created holes (h&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) are then consumed during the dissolution of silicon. There are several possible reactions via which the dissolution can take place, but here just one example is given:

:{{chem2 | Si + 6 HF + 4 h+ -&gt; SiF6^{2-} + 6 H+ }}

There are still some unclear aspects of the MACE process. The model proposed above requires contact of the metal particle with the silicon substrate which is somehow conflicting with the etching solution being underneath the particle. This can be explained with a dissolution and redeposition of metal during MACE. In particular it is proposed, that some metal ions from the particle are dissolved and eventually are re-deposited at the silicon surface with a redox reaction. In this case the metal particle (or even larger noble metal thin films) could partially maintain contact to the substrate while also etching could partially take place underneath the metal.&lt;ref name=geyer2&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Geyer |first1=Nadine |last2=Fuhrmann |first2=Bodo |last3=Huang |first3=Zhipeng |last4=de Boor |first4=Johannes |last5=Leipner |first5=Hartmut S. |last6=Werner |first6=Peter |title=Model for the Mass Transport during Metal-Assisted Chemical Etching with Contiguous Metal Films As Catalysts |journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry C |date=21 June 2012 |volume=116 |issue=24 |pages=13446–13451 |doi=10.1021/jp3034227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also observed that in the vicinity of straight pores as shown in the introduction also a micro-porous region between the pores is formed. Generally this is attributed to holes that diffuse away from the particle and hence contribute to etching at more distant locations.&lt;ref name="li2"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Li |first1=Xiuling |title=Metal assisted chemical etching for high aspect ratio nanostructures: A review of characteristics and applications in photovoltaics |journal=Current Opinion in Solid State and Materials Science |date=April 2012 |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=71–81 |doi=10.1016/j.cossms.2011.11.002|bibcode=2012COSSM..16...71L }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This behavior is dependent on the doping type of substrate as well as on the type of noble metal particle. Therefore, it is proposed that the formation of such a porous region beneath the straight pores depends on the type of barrier that is formed at the metal/silicon interface. In the case of an upward [[band bending]] the electric field in the [[depletion layer]] would point towards the metal. Therefore, holes cannot diffuse further into the substrate and thus no formation of a micro-porous region is observed. In the case of downward band-bending holes could escape into the bulk of the silicon substrate and eventually lead to etching there.&lt;ref name="ruby"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lai |first1=Ruby A. |last2=Hymel |first2=Thomas M. |last3=Narasimhan |first3=Vijay K. |last4=Cui |first4=Yi |title=Schottky Barrier Catalysis Mechanism in Metal-Assisted Chemical Etching of Silicon |journal=ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces |date=13 April 2016 |volume=8 |issue=14 |pages=8875–8879 |doi=10.1021/acsami.6b01020|pmid=27018712 |osti=1579822 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Experimental procedure of MACE ==
[[File:Mace particles.png|thumb|Silver nanoparticles at the surface of a silicon wafer after immersion into a solution containing [[silver nitrate]] and hydrofluoric acid.]]
As already stated above MACE requires metal particles or a thin metal thin film on top of a silicon substrate. This can be achieved with several methods such as [[sputter deposition]] or [[Evaporation (deposition)|thermal evaporation]].&lt;ref name = kabalan&gt;Kabalan, Amal. "A Comparative Study on the Effects of Passivation Methods on the Carrier Lifetime of RIE and MACE Silicon Micropillars." Applied Sciences 9.9 (2019): 1804.&lt;/ref&gt; A method to obtain particles from a continuous thin film is thermal [[dewetting]].&lt;ref name = backes&gt;Backes, A., et al. "Influence of metallic catalyst and doping level on the metal assisted chemical etching of silicon." Scripta Materialia 114 (2016): 27-30.&lt;/ref&gt;
These deposition methods can be combined with [[Photolithography|lithography]]&lt;ref name = chang&gt;Chang, Shih‐Wei, et al. "Densely packed arrays of ultra‐high‐aspect‐ratio silicon nanowires fabricated using block‐copolymer lithography and metal‐assisted etching." Advanced functional materials 19.15 (2009): 2495-2500.&lt;/ref&gt; such that only desired regions are covered with metal. Since MACE is an anisotropic etching method (etching takes place not in all spatial directions) a pre-defined metal pattern can be directly transferred into the silicon substrate.
Another method of depositing metal particles or thin films is [[electroless plating]] of noble metals on the surface of silicon. Since the redox potentials of the redox couples of noble metals are below the valence band edge of silicon, noble metal ions can (like described in the theory section) inject holes (or extract electrons) from the substrate while they are reduced. In the end metallic particles or films are obtained at the surface.&lt;ref name = smith&gt;Smith, Zachary R., Rosemary L. Smith, and Scott D. Collins. "Mechanism of nanowire formation in metal assisted chemical etching." Electrochimica Acta 92 (2013): 139-147.&lt;/ref&gt;
Finally, after the deposition of the metal on the surface of silicon, the sample is immersed in an etching solution containing hydrofluoric acid and oxidizing agent. Etching will take place as long as the oxidizing agent and the acid are consumed or until the sample is removed from the etching solution.

== Applications of MACE ==
[[File:Etch anisotropy.png|thumb|164x164px|Schematic depiction of a silicon substrate that is covered with a protective layer (red). 1: Wet chemical etching leads to isotropic etching 2: Etching methods that operate in the gas-phase allow anisotropic etching but are expensive.]]
The reason why MACE is heavily researched is that it allows completely anisotropic etching of silicon substrates which is not possible with other wet chemical etching methods (see figure to the right). Usually the silicon substrate is covered with a protective layer such as [[photoresist]] before it is immersed in an etching solution. The etching solution usually has no preferred direction of attacking the substrate, therefore isotropic etching takes place. In semiconductor engineering, however it is often required that the sidewalls of the etched trenches are steep. This is usually realized with methods that operate in the gas-phase such as [[reactive ion etching]]. These methods require expensive equipment compared to simple wet etching. MACE, in principle allows the fabrication of steep trenches but is still cheap compared to gas-phase etching methods.

=== Porous silicon ===
Metal assisted chemical etching allows for the production of [[porous silicon]] with [[photoluminescence]].&lt;ref name=li/&gt;

=== Black silicon ===
[[Black silicon]] is silicon with a modified surface and is a type of [[porous silicon]]. There are several works{{Clarification needed|reason=|date=September 2019}} on obtaining [[black silicon]] using MACE technology. The main application of black silicon is [[solar energy]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Black gallium arsenide ===
Black gallium arsenide with light trapping properties have been also produced by MACE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lova |first1=Paola |first2=Valentina |last2=Robbiano |first3=Franco |last3=Cacialli |first4=Davide |last4=Comoretto |first5=Cesare |last5=Soci|title=Black GaAs by Metal-Assisted Chemical Etching |journal=ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces |date=2018 |volume=10 |issue=39 |pages=33434–33440 |doi=10.1021/acsami.8b10370 |pmid=30191706 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="9283" sha1="2wjm2m3fts6lvrmhqpcw7r0bwyfr2os" xml:space="preserve">In the mathematical theory of [[probability]], a '''generalized renewal process (GRP) ''' or '''G-renewal process''' is a stochastic point process used to model failure/repair behavior of repairable systems in [[reliability engineering]]. [[Poisson point process]] is a particular case of GRP.

== Probabilistic model ==
=== Virtual age ===
The G-renewal process is introduced by [[Masaaki Kijima|Kijima]] and Sumita through the notion of the ''virtual age''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kijima |first1=Masaaki|last2=Sumita|first2=Ushio |title=A Useful Generalization of Renewal Theory: Counting Processes Governed by Non-Negative Markovian Increments |journal=Journal of Applied Probability |year=1986 |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=71–88 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3214117 |publisher=Applied Probability Trust|doi=10.2307/3214117 |jstor=3214117 |s2cid=222275620 |url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;y_i = q t_i &lt;/math&gt;
::where:
:: &lt;math&gt; t_i &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; y_i &lt;/math&gt; is real and virtual age (respectively) of the system at/after the ''i''{{sup|th}} repair,
:: &lt;math&gt; q &lt;/math&gt; is the ''restoration factor'' (a.k.a., repair effectiveness factor),
::::&lt;math&gt; q=0 &lt;/math&gt;, represents the condition of a perfect repair, where the system age is reset to zero after the repair. This condition corresponds to the ''Ordinary Renewal Process''.
::::&lt;math&gt; q=1 &lt;/math&gt;, represents the condition of a minimal repair, where the system condition after the repair remains the same as right before the repair. This condition corresponds to the ''Non-Homogeneous Poisson Process''.
::::&lt;math&gt; 0&lt;q&lt;1 &lt;/math&gt;, represents the condition of a general repair, where the system condition is between perfect repair and minimal repair. This condition corresponds to the ''Generalized Renewal Process''.
Kaminskiy and Krivtsov &lt;ref name="foo"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Kaminskiy |first1= M.P.|last2= Krivtsov|first2= V.V.|date= 1998|chapter= A Monte Carlo approach to repairable system reliability analysis|title= Probabilistic Safety Assessment and Management|location= London|url = http://www.bookfinder4u.com/IsbnSearch.aspx?isbn=3540762620&amp;mode=direct| publisher= Springer–Verlag|pages= 1063–1068}}&lt;/ref&gt; extended the [[Masaaki Kijima|Kijima]] models by allowing ''q''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1, so that the repair damages (ages) the system to a higher degree than it was just before the respective failure.

===G-renewal equation===
Mathematically, the G-renewal process is quantified through the solution of the G-renewal equation:
:&lt;math&gt;W(t) = \int_0^t(  g(\tau \mid 0) + \int_0^\tau w(x) \cdot (g(\tau - x \mid x) \,dx  )\,d\tau &lt;/math&gt;
:where,
::&lt;math&gt;g(\tau \mid x) = \frac{(t+qx,\theta)}{1-F(qx,\theta)}&lt;/math&gt;   &lt;math&gt; t,x \geq 0 &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; w(x) = \frac{dW(x)}{dx} &lt;/math&gt;   
:: ''f''(''t'') is the [[Probability density function|probability density function (PDF)]] of the underlying failure time distribution,
:: ''F''(''t'') is the [[cumulative distribution function]] (CDF) of the underlying failure time distribution,
:: ''q'' is the restoration factor,
:: &lt;math&gt; {\theta} &lt;/math&gt; is the vector of parameters of the underlying failure-time distribution.
A [[Closed-form expression|closed-form solution]] to the G-renewal equation is not possible. Also, numerical approximations are difficult to obtain due to the recurrent infinite series. A [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo]] based approach to solving the G-renewal Equation was developed by Kaminiskiy and Krivtsov.&lt;ref name="foo" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |type=PhD |last=Krivtsov |first=V. V. |date=2000 |title=Modeling and estimation of the generalized renewal process in repairable system reliability analysis |url=https://catalog.umd.edu/F/?func=find-b&amp;local%5Fbase=cp&amp;find%5Fcode=035&amp;request=ocm47871209&amp;pds%5Fhandle=GUEST&amp;pds%5Fhandle=GUEST&amp;pds%5Fhandle=GUEST&amp;pds_handle=GUEST |publisher=University of Maryland, College Park, ISBN/ISSN: 0599725877}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Statistical estimation == 
The G–renewal process gained its practical popularity in [[reliability engineering]] only after methods for estimating its parameters had become available.

=== Monte Carlo approach ===
The [[Non-linear least squares|nonlinear LSQ estimation]] of the G–renewal process was first offered by Kaminskiy &amp; Krivtsov.&lt;ref name="foo" /&gt; A random inter-arrival time from a parameterized G-Renewal process is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;X_i = F^{-1} (1-U_i[1- F(qS_{i-1})]) - qS_{i-1} &lt;/math&gt;
: where,
:: &lt;math&gt; S_{i-1} &lt;/math&gt; is the cumulative real age before the i{{sup|th}} inter-arrival,
:: &lt;math&gt; U_i &lt;/math&gt; is a uniformly distributed [[random variable]],
:: &lt;math&gt; F &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Cumulative distribution function|CDF]] of the underlying failure-time distribution.
The Monte Carlo solution was subsequently improved&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Yevkin |first= A.|editor-first1= Christophe|editor-first2= Antoine|editor-first3= Carlos|editor-last1= Berenguer|editor-last2= Grall|editor-last3= Guedes Soares|date= 2011|chapter= Monte Carlo Approach for Evaluation of Availability and Failure Intensity under G–Renewal Process Model|title= Advances in Safety, Reliability and Risk Management|location= London|url = https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.1201/b11939/advances-safety-reliability-risk-management-christophe-berenguer-antoine-grall-carlos-guedes-soares| publisher= CRC Press|pages= 1015–1020|doi= 10.1201/b11939|isbn= 9780429217265}}&lt;/ref&gt; and implemented as a web resource.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.soft4structures.com/WeibullGRP/JSPageGRP.jsp|title= G-Renewal Process Calculator|last= Yevkin |first= A.|access-date= May 13, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Maximum likelihood approach ===
The [[Maximum likelihood estimation|maximum likelihood]] procedures were subsequently discussed by Yañez, et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Yañez |first1= M. |last2= Joglar |first2= F.|last3= Modarres |first3= M.|date= August 2002|title= Generalized renewal process for analysis of repairable systems with limited failure experience |url= https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0951832002000443|journal= Reliability Engineering &amp; System Safety |volume=  77|issue= 2|pages= 167–180|doi= 10.1016/S0951-8320(02)00044-3 |url-access= subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mettas &amp; Zhao.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url= https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1408358|title= Modeling and analysis of repairable systems with general repair
|last1= Mettas|first1= A.|last2= Zhao|first2= W.|date= 24 January 2005|location= Alexandria, VA
|conference= Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The estimation of the G–renewal restoration factor was addressed in detail by Kahle &amp; Love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Kahle |first1= W. |last2= Love|first2= C.|title= Modeling the Influence of Maintenance Actions |date= 2003|url= https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812795250_0025|journal= Mathematical and Statistical Methods in Reliability |series= Series on Quality, Reliability and Engineering Statistics |volume= 7 |pages= 387–399|doi= 10.1142/9789812795250_0025 |isbn= 978-981-238-321-1 |url-access= subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Regularization method in estimating GRP parameters ===
The estimation of G–renewal process parameters is an ill–posed [[inverse problem]], and therefore, the solution may not be unique and is sensitive to the input data. Krivtsov &amp; Yevkin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Krivtsov|first1= V.V. |last2= Yevkin|first2= O.|date= July 2013|title= Estimation of G-renewal process parameters as an ill-posed inverse problem |url= https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0951832013000409|journal= Reliability Engineering &amp; System Safety |volume=  115|pages= 10–18|doi= 10.1016/j.ress.2013.02.005 |url-access= subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url= https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7889707|title= Regularization techniques for recurrent failure prediction under Kijima models|last1= Krivtsov|first1= Vasiliy|last2= Yevkin|first2= Alex|date= 2017|location= Orlando, FL|conference= Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested first to estimate the underlying distribution parameters using the time to first failures only. Then, the obtained parameters are used as the initial values for the second step, whereat all model parameters (including the restoration factor(s)) are estimated simultaneously. This approach allows, on the one hand, to avoid irrelevant solutions (wrong local maximums or minimums of the objective function) and on the other hand, to improve computational speed, as the number of iterations significantly depends on the selected initial values.

== Limitations ==

One limitation of the Generalized Renewal Process is that it cannot account for "better-than-new" repair. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last1= Kaminskiy|first1= M.P. |last2= Krivtsov|first2= V.V.|date= June 2010|title= G1-Renewal Process as Repairable System Model |class= stat.ME |eprint= 1006.3718 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[G1-renewal process]] has been developed which applies the restoration factor to the life parameter of a location-scale distribution to be able to account for "better-than-new" repair in addition to other repair types.

A moving charge in a magnetic field experiences a force perpendicular to its own velocity and to the magnetic field.{{Rp|ch13}}&lt;ref&gt;Purcell, Edward. p278. Electricity and Magnetism, 3rd edition, [[Cambridge University Press]], 2013. 839pp.&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[permanent magnet]]'s magnetic field pulls on [[ferromagnetic material]]s such as [[iron]], and attracts or repels other magnets.  In addition, a magnetic field that varies with location will exert a force on a range of non-magnetic materials by affecting the motion of their outer atomic electrons. Magnetic fields surround magnetized materials, and are created by electric currents such as those used in [[electromagnet]]s, and by [[electric field]]s varying in time.  Since both strength and direction of a magnetic field may vary with location, they are described as a map assigning a vector to each point of space or, more precisely—because of the way the magnetic field transforms under mirror reflection—as a [[Field (physics)|field]] of [[pseudovector]]s.

In [[electromagnetics]], the term "magnetic field" is used for two distinct but closely related vector fields denoted by the symbols {{math|'''B'''}} and {{math|'''H'''}}. In the [[International System of Units]], {{math|'''H'''}}, magnetic field strength, is measured in the SI base units of [[ampere]] per meter (A/m).&lt;ref&gt;{{SIbrochure9th}}, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; {{math|'''B'''}}, [[magnetic flux]] density, is measured in [[tesla (unit)|tesla]] (in SI base units: kilogram per second&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; per ampere),&lt;ref&gt;{{SIbrochure9th}}, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; which is equivalent to [[newton (unit)|newton]] per meter per ampere. {{math|'''H'''}} and {{math|'''B'''}} differ in how they account for magnetization. In [[vacuum]], the two fields are related through the [[vacuum permeability]], &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}/\mu_0 = \mathbf{H}&lt;/math&gt;; but in a magnetized material, the terms differ by the material's [[magnetization]] at each point.}}
{{term|term= '''[[Magnetism]]'''}}{{defn|defn=is a class of physical attributes that are mediated by [[magnetic field]]s. [[Electric current]]s and the [[magnetic moment]]s of elementary particles give rise to a magnetic field, which acts on other currents and magnetic moments. Magnetism is one aspect of the combined phenomenon of [[electromagnetism]]. The most familiar effects occur in [[ferromagnetic]] materials, which are strongly attracted by magnetic fields and can be [[magnetization|magnetized]] to become permanent [[magnet]]s, producing magnetic fields themselves.  Demagnetizing a magnet is also possible.  Only a few substances are ferromagnetic; the most common ones are [[iron]], [[cobalt]] and [[nickel]] and their alloys. The rare-earth metals [[neodymium]] and [[samarium]] are less common examples. The prefix ''{{linktext|ferro-}}'' refers to [[iron]], because permanent magnetism was first observed in [[lodestone]], a form of natural iron ore called [[magnetite]], Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.}}
{{term|term= '''[[Manufacturing engineering]]'''}}{{defn|defn=is a branch of professional [[engineering]] that shares many common concepts and ideas with other fields of engineering such as mechanical, chemical, electrical, and industrial engineering. 
Manufacturing engineering requires the ability to plan the practices of manufacturing; to research and to develop tools, processes, machines and equipment; and to integrate the facilities and systems for producing quality products with the optimum expenditure of capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|doi = 10.1007/978-94-011-7038-3_1|title = Handbook of Electronics Manufacturing Engineering|pages = 1–4|year = 1986|last1 = Matisoff|first1 = Bernard S.|isbn = 978-94-011-7040-6|chapter = Manufacturing Engineering: Definition and Purpose}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{term|term= '''[[Mass balance]]'''}}{{defn|defn=A mass balance, also called a ''material balance'', is an application of [[conservation of mass]] to the analysis of physical systems. By accounting for material entering and leaving a system, [[Mass flow (physics)|mass flow]]s can be identified which might have been unknown, or difficult to measure without this technique.  The exact [[conservation law]] used in the analysis of the system depends on the context of the problem, but all revolve around mass conservation, i.e., that [[matter]] cannot disappear or be created spontaneously.&lt;ref name="himmelblau"&gt;{{cite book | last = Himmelblau | first = David M. | title = Basic Principles and Calculations in Chemical Engineering | edition = 2nd | date = 1967 | publisher = [[Prentice Hall]] | url = http://www.pearsonhighered.com/educator/product/Basic-Principles-and-Calculations-in-Chemical-Engineering/9780132346603.page}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|59–62}}}}
{{term|term= '''[[Mass density]]'''}}{{defn|defn=The ''density'' (more precisely, the ''volumetric mass density''; also known as ''specific mass''), of a substance is its [[mass]] per unit [[volume]]. The symbol most often used for density is ''ρ'' (the lower case Greek letter [[rho]]), although the Latin letter ''D'' can also be used. Mathematically, density is defined as mass divided by volume:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/BGH/fluden.html | title =Gas Density Glenn research Center | author =''[[National Aeronautic and Space Administration|The National Aeronautic and Atmospheric Administration's]]'' ''[[Glenn Research Center]]'' | publisher =grc.nasa.gov | url-status =dead | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20130414132531/http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/BGH/fluden.html | archive-date =April 14, 2013 | df =mdy-all | access-date =April 9, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \rho = \frac{m}{V}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''ρ'' is the density, ''m'' is the mass, and ''V'' is the volume. In some cases (for instance, in the United States oil and gas industry), density is loosely defined as its [[weight]] per unit [[volume]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oilgasglossary.com/density.html |title=Density definition in Oil Gas Glossary |publisher=Oilgasglossary.com |access-date=September 14, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100805010226/http://oilgasglossary.com/density.html |archive-date=August 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although this is scientifically inaccurate – this quantity is more specifically called [[specific weight]].}}

It depends on the body's mass distribution and the axis chosen, with larger moments requiring more torque to change the body's rate of rotation.}}
{{term|term= '''[[Mass number]]'''}}{{defn|defn=The mass number (symbol ''A'', from the German word ''Atomgewicht'' [atomic weight]),&lt;ref&gt;[[Jensen, William B.]] (2005).

It is approximately equal to the [[atomic mass|''atomic'' (also known as ''isotopic'') mass]] of the [[atom]] expressed in [[atomic mass unit]]s. Since protons and neutrons are both [[baryon]]s, the mass number ''A'' is identical with the [[baryon number]] ''B'' of the nucleus (and also of the whole atom or [[ion]]). The mass number is different for each different [[isotope]] of a [[chemical element]]. Hence, the difference between the mass number and the [[atomic number]]&amp;nbsp;''Z'' gives the [[number of neutrons]] (''N'') in a given nucleus: {{nowrap|1=''N'' = ''A'' − ''Z''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.jlab.org/qa/pen_number.html|title=How many protons, electrons and neutrons are in an atom of krypton, carbon, oxygen, neon, silver, gold, etc...?|publisher=Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility|access-date=2008-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mass number is written either after the element name or as a [[superscript]] to the left of an element's symbol. For example, the most common isotope of [[carbon]] is [[carbon-12]], or {{SimpleNuclide|carbon|12}}, which has 6 protons and 6 neutrons. The full isotope symbol would also have the atomic number (''Z'') as a subscript to the left of the element symbol directly below the mass number: {{nuclide|carbon|12}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordhamprep.org/gcurran/sho/sho/lessons/lesson35.htm|title=Elemental Notation and Isotopes|publisher=Science Help Online|access-date=2008-08-27|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913063710/http://www.fordhamprep.org/gcurran/sho/sho/lessons/lesson35.htm|archive-date=2008-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
{{term|term= '''[[Mass spectrometry]]'''}}{{defn|defn=(MS), is an analytical technique that is used to measure the [[mass-to-charge ratio]] of  [[ion]]s. The results are typically presented as a [[mass spectrum]], a plot of intensity as a function of the mass-to-charge ratio. Mass spectrometry is used in many different fields and is applied to pure samples as well as complex mixtures.}}
{{term|term= '''[[Material failure theory]]'''}}{{defn|defn=is an interdisciplinary field of [[materials science]] and [[solid mechanics]] which attempts to [[Failure analysis|predict the conditions]] under which solid [[material]]s fail under the action of [[Structural load|external loads]]. The failure of a material is usually classified into [[brittle]] failure ([[fracture]]) or [[ductile]] failure ([[yield (engineering)|yield]]). Depending on the conditions (such as [[temperature]], state of [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]], loading rate) most materials can fail in a brittle or ductile manner or both. However, for most practical situations, a material may be classified as either brittle or ductile.

In mathematical terms, failure theory is expressed in the form of various failure criteria which are valid for specific materials.  Failure criteria are functions in [[Stress–strain analysis|stress or strain space]] which separate "failed" states from "unfailed" states.  A precise physical definition of a "failed" state is not easily quantified and several working definitions are in use in the engineering community.  Quite often, phenomenological failure criteria of the same form are used to predict brittle failure and ductile yields.}}
{{term|term= '''[[Material properties]]'''}}{{defn|defn=A material's property is an [[intensive property]] of some [[chemical change|material]], i.e., a [[physical property]] that does not depend on the amount of the material. These quantitative properties may be used as a [[figure of merit|metric]] by which the benefits of one material versus another can be compared, thereby aiding in [[materials selection]].}}
{{term|term= '''[[Materials science]]'''}}{{defn|defn=The [[interdisciplinary]] field of materials science, also commonly termed ''materials science and engineering'', covers the design and discovery of new materials, particularly [[solid]]s.

As such, the field was long considered by academic institutions as a sub-field of these related fields. Beginning in the 1940s, materials science began to be more widely recognized as a specific and distinct field of science and engineering, and major technical universities around the world created dedicated schools for its study.

Materials scientists emphasize understanding, how the history of a material (''processing'') influences its structure, and thus the material's properties and performance. The understanding of processing-structure-properties relationships is called the materials paradigm. This [[paradigm]] is used to advance understanding in a variety of research areas, including [[nanotechnology]], [[biomaterial]]s, and [[metallurgy]].

Materials science is also an important part of [[forensic engineering]] and [[failure analysis]]{{snd}} investigating materials, products, structures or components, which fail or do not function as intended, causing personal injury or damage to property. Such investigations are key to understanding, for example, the causes of various [[aviation accidents and incidents]].}}

In the simplest case, an [[optimization problem]] consists of [[maxima and minima|maximizing or minimizing]] a [[real function]] by systematically choosing [[Argument of a function|input]] values from within an allowed set and computing the [[Value (mathematics)|value]] of the function. The generalization of optimization theory and techniques to other formulations constitutes a large area of [[applied mathematics]].

{{term|term= '''[[Matrix (mathematics)|Matrix]]'''}}{{defn|defn=In [[mathematics]], a matrix (plural ''matrices'') is a [[rectangular]] array or table of [[number]]s, [[symbol (formal)|symbol]]s, or [[expression (mathematics)|expression]]s, arranged in rows and columns, which is used to represent a [[mathematical object]] or a property of such an object. For example, 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 9 &amp; -13 \\20 &amp; 5 &amp; -6 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
is a matrix with two rows and three columns; one say often a "two by three matrix", a "{{math|2×3}}-matrix", or a matrix of dimension {{math|2×3}}.

Without further specifications, matrices represent [[linear maps]], and allow explicit computations in [[linear algebra]]. Therefore, the study of matrices is a large part of linear algebra, and most properties and [[operation (mathematics)|operations]] of abstract linear algebra can be expressed in terms of matrices. For example, [[matrix multiplication]] represents [[function composition|composition]] of linear maps.

Not all matrices are related to linear algebra. This is in particular the case, in [[graph theory]], of [[incidence matrix|incidence matrices]] and [[adjacency matrix|adjacency matrices]].&lt;ref&gt;However, in the case of adjacency matrices, [[matrix multiplication]] or a variant of it allows the simultaneous computation of the number of paths between any two vertices, and of the shortest length of a path between two vertices.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

The equations provide a mathematical model for electric, optical, and radio technologies, such as power generation, electric motors, [[wireless]] communication, lenses, radar etc. They describe how [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field]]s are generated by [[electric charge|charges]], [[electric current|currents]], and changes of the fields.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;''Electric'' and ''magnetic'' fields, according to the [[theory of relativity]], are the components of a single electromagnetic field.&lt;/ref&gt; The equations are named after the physicist and mathematician [[James Clerk Maxwell]], who, in 1861 and 1862, published an early form of the equations that included the Lorentz force law. Maxwell first used the equations to propose that light is an electromagnetic phenomenon.

An important consequence of Maxwell's equations is that they demonstrate how fluctuating electric and magnetic fields propagate at a constant speed (''[[Speed of light|c]]'') in vacuum.

{{term|term= '''[[Mean]]'''}}{{defn|defn=There are several kinds of ''mean'' in [[mathematics]], especially in [[statistics]]:

For a [[data set]], the [[arithmetic mean]], also known as [[average]] or arithmetic average, is a central value of a finite set of numbers: specifically, the sum of the values divided by the number of values. The arithmetic mean of a set of numbers ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., x''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is typically denoted by &lt;math&gt;\bar{x}&lt;/math&gt;{{refn|Pronounced "''x'' bar".|group="note"}}. If the data set were based on a series of observations obtained by [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]] from a [[statistical population]], the arithmetic mean is the ''sample mean'' (denoted &lt;math&gt;\bar{x}&lt;/math&gt;) to distinguish it from the mean, or [[expected value]], of the underlying distribution, the ''population mean'' (denoted '''&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;''' or '''&lt;math&gt;\mu_x&lt;/math&gt;'''{{refn|Greek letter [[μ]], for "mean", pronounced /'mjuː/.|group="note"}}).&lt;ref&gt;Underhill, L.G.; Bradfield d.

In [[probability]] and [[statistics]], the ''population mean'', or expected value, is a measure of the [[central tendency]] either of a [[probability distribution]] or of a [[random variable]] characterized by that distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Feller|first=William|title=Introduction to Probability Theory and its Applications, Vol I|year=1950|publisher=[[Wiley (publisher)|Wiley]]|isbn=0471257087|pages=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[discrete probability distribution]] of a random variable ''X'', the mean is equal to the sum over every possible value weighted by the probability of that value; that is, it is computed by taking the product of each possible value ''x'' of ''X'' and its probability ''p''(''x''), and then adding all these products together, giving &lt;math&gt;\mu = \sum x p(x)....&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Elementary Statistics by Robert R.

Not every probability distribution has a defined mean (see the [[Cauchy distribution]] for an example). Moreover, the mean can be infinite for some distributions.

For a finite population, the ''population mean'' of a property is equal to the arithmetic mean of the given property, while considering every member of the population. For example, the population mean height is equal to the sum of the heights of every individual—divided by the total number of individuals. The sample mean may differ from the population mean, especially for small samples. The [[law of large numbers]] states that the larger the size of the sample, the more likely it is that the sample mean will be close to the population mean.&lt;ref&gt;Schaum's Outline of Theory and Problems of Probability by Seymour Lipschutz and Marc Lipson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZKdqlw2ZnAMC&amp;pg=PA141 p. 141]&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside probability and statistics, a wide range of other notions of mean are often used in [[geometry]] and [[mathematical analysis]].}}
{{term|term= '''[[Measure of central tendency]]'''}}{{defn|defn=In [[statistics]], a ''central tendency'' (or ''measure of central tendency'') is a central or typical value for a [[probability distribution]].&lt;ref name=Weisberg&gt;Weisberg H.F (1992) ''Central Tendency and Variability'', Sage University Paper Series on Quantitative Applications in the Social Sciences,  {{ISBN|0-8039-4007-6}} p.2&lt;/ref&gt; It may also be called a ''center'' or ''location'' of the distribution. Colloquially, measures of central tendency are often called ''[[averages]].'' The term ''central tendency'' dates from the late 1920s.&lt;ref name=Upton/&gt;

The most common measures of central tendency are the [[arithmetic mean]], the [[median]], and the [[Mode (statistics)|mode]].  A middle tendency can be calculated for either a finite set of values or for a theoretical distribution, such as the [[normal distribution]]. Occasionally authors use central tendency to denote "the tendency of quantitative [[data]] to cluster around some central value."&lt;ref name=Upton&gt;Upton, G.; Cook, I.

(2003) ''The Oxford Dictionary of Statistical Terms'', OUP for [[International Statistical Institute]]. {{ISBN|0-19-920613-9}} (entry for "central tendency")&lt;/ref&gt;

The two measures are complementary in sense that if one knows the mid-range and the range, one can find the sample maximum and minimum values.

The mid-range is rarely used in practical statistical analysis, as it lacks [[#Efficiency|efficiency]] as an estimator for most distributions of interest,  because it ignores all intermediate points, and lacks [[#Robustness|robustness]], as outliers change it significantly. Indeed, it is one of the least efficient and least robust statistics. However, it finds some use in special cases: it is the maximally efficient estimator for the center of a uniform distribution, trimmed mid-ranges address robustness, and as an [[L-estimator]], it is simple to understand and compute.}}
{{term|term= '''[[Midhinge]]'''}}{{defn|defn=In [[statistics]], the midhinge is the average of the first and third [[quartile]]s and is thus a measure of [[location parameter|location]].
Equivalently, it is the 25% [[trimmed estimator|trimmed]] [[mid-range]] or 25% [[midsummary]]; it is an [[L-estimator]].
: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{MH}(X) = \overline{Q_{1, 3}(X)} = \frac{Q_1(X) + Q_3(X)}{2} = \frac{P_{25}(X) + P_{75}(X)}{2} = M_{25}(X)&lt;/math&gt;

The midhinge is related to the [[interquartile range]] (IQR), the difference of the third and first [[quartile]]s (i.e. &lt;math&gt;IQR = Q_3 - Q_1&lt;/math&gt;), which is a measure of [[statistical dispersion]]. The two are complementary in sense that if one knows the midhinge and the IQR, one can find the first and third quartiles.

The use of the term "hinge" for the lower or upper quartiles derives from [[John Tukey]]'s work on [[exploratory data analysis]] in the late 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;Tukey, J. W. (1977) ''Exploratory Data Analysis'', Addison-Wesley. {{ISBN|0-201-07616-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "midhinge" is a fairly modern term dating from around that time. The midhinge is slightly simpler to calculate than the [[trimean]] (&lt;math&gt;TM&lt;/math&gt;), which originated in the same context and equals the average of the [[median]] (&lt;math&gt;\tilde{X} = Q_2 = P_{50}&lt;/math&gt;) and the midhinge.

: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{MH}(X) = 2 \operatorname{TM}(X) - \operatorname{med}(X) = 2 \frac{Q_1 + 2Q_2 + Q3}{4} - Q_2&lt;/math&gt;}}

{{term|term= '''[[Miller indices]]'''}}{{defn|defn=Miller indices form a notation system in [[crystallography]] for planes in [[Bravais lattice|crystal (Bravais) lattices]].

In particular, a family of [[lattice plane]]s is determined by three [[integer]]s ''h'', ''k'', and&amp;nbsp;''ℓ'', the ''Miller indices''.  They are written (hkℓ), and denote the family of planes orthogonal to &lt;math&gt;h\mathbf{b_1} + k\mathbf{b_2} + \ell\mathbf{b_3}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b_i}&lt;/math&gt; are the [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] of the [[reciprocal lattice]] vectors (note that the plane is not always orthogonal to the linear combination of direct lattice vectors &lt;math&gt;h\mathbf{a_1} + k\mathbf{a_2} + \ell\mathbf{a_3}&lt;/math&gt; because the  lattice vectors need not be mutually orthogonal). By convention, [[negative integer]]s are written with a bar, as in {{overline|3}} for&amp;nbsp;−3.  The integers are usually written in lowest terms, i.e. their [[greatest common divisor]] should be&amp;nbsp;1. Miller indices are also used to designate reflections in [[X-ray crystallography]]. In this case the integers are not necessarily in lowest terms, and can be thought of as corresponding to planes spaced such that the reflections from adjacent planes would have a phase difference of exactly one wavelength (2π), regardless of whether there are atoms on all these planes or not.

{{term|term='''[[Parity (physics)]]'''}}{{defn|defn=In [[quantum mechanics]], a parity transformation (also called parity inversion) is the flip in the sign of ''one'' [[Three-dimensional space|spatial]] [[coordinate]]. In three dimensions, it can also refer to the simultaneous flip in the sign of all three spatial coordinates (a [[point reflection]]):
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}: \begin{pmatrix}x\\y\\z\end{pmatrix} \mapsto \begin{pmatrix}-x\\-y\\-z\end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

It can also be thought of as a test for [[Chirality (physics)|chirality]] of a physical phenomenon, in that a parity inversion transforms a phenomenon into its mirror image. All fundamental interactions of [[elementary particle]]s, with the exception of the [[weak interaction]], are symmetric under parity. The weak interaction is chiral and thus provides a means for probing chirality in physics. In interactions that are symmetric under parity, such as electromagnetism in atomic and molecular physics, parity serves as a powerful controlling principle underlying quantum transitions.

A matrix representation of '''P''' (in any number of dimensions) has [[determinant]] equal to −1, and hence is distinct from a [[rotation]], which has a determinant equal to 1. In a two-dimensional plane, a simultaneous flip of all coordinates in sign is ''not'' a parity transformation; it is the same as a 180°-[[rotation]].

In [[quantum mechanics]], wave functions that are unchanged by a parity transformation are described as [[Even and odd functions|even]] functions, while those that change sign under a parity transformation are odd functions.fn=A hydrocarbon compound, solid at room temperature.}}

Although there are several different [[probability interpretations]], probability theory treats the concept in a rigorous mathematical manner by expressing it through a set of [[axioms of probability|axioms]].

Although it is not possible to perfectly predict random events, much can be said about their behavior. Two major results in probability theory describing such behaviour are the [[law of large numbers]] and the [[central limit theorem]].

The symbol for rotational speed is &lt;math&gt;\omega_\text{cyc}&lt;/math&gt;{{Citation needed|date=February 2015|reason=sub "cyc"?}}(the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] lowercase letter "omega").

[[Speed#Tangential speed|Tangential speed]] ''v'', rotational speed &lt;math&gt;\omega_\text{cyc}&lt;/math&gt;, and [[Polar coordinate system|radial distan]]ce ''r'', are related by the following equation:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/rotq.html|title = Rotational Quantities}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;v = 2\pi r\omega_\text{cyc}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;v = r\omega_\text{rad}&lt;/math&gt;

An algebraic rearrangement of this equation allows us to solve for rotational speed:
: &lt;math&gt;\omega_\text{cyc} = v/2\pi r&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\omega_\text{rad} = v/r&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the tangential speed will be directly proportional to ''r'' when all parts of a system simultaneously have the same ω, as for a wheel, disk, or rigid wand. The direct proportionality of ''v'' to ''r'' is not valid for the [[planet]]s, because the planets have different rotational speeds (ω).

Rotational speed can measure, for example, how fast a motor is running. Rotational speed and [[angular speed]] are sometimes used as synonyms, but typically they are measured with a different unit. Angular speed, however, tells the change in [[angle]] per time unit, which is measured in [[radians per second]] in the SI system. Since there are 2π radians per cycle, or 360 degrees per cycle, we can convert angular speed to rotational speed by
: &lt;math&gt;\omega_\text{cyc} = \omega_\text{rad}/2\pi\,&lt;/math&gt;
and
: &lt;math&gt;\omega_\text{cyc} = \omega_\text{deg}/360\,&lt;/math&gt;
where
* &lt;math&gt;\omega_\text{cyc}\,&lt;/math&gt; is rotational speed in cycles per second
* &lt;math&gt;\omega_\text{rad}\,&lt;/math&gt; is angular speed in radians per second
* &lt;math&gt;\omega_\text{deg}\,&lt;/math&gt; is angular speed in degrees per second

For example, a [[stepper motor]] might turn exactly one complete revolution each second.
Its angular speed is 360 [[degree (angle)|degrees]] per second (360°/s), or 2π [[radian]]s per second (2π&amp;nbsp;rad/s), while the rotational speed is 60&amp;nbsp;rpm.

Rotational speed is not to be confused with [[Speed#Tangential speed|tangential speed]], despite some relation between the two concepts. Imagine a rotating merry-go-round. No matter how close or far one stands from the axis of rotation, the rotational speed will remain constant. However, tangential speed does not remain constant. If one stands two meters from the axis of rotation, the tangential speed will be double the amount if one were standing only one meter from the axis of rotation.}}

{{term|term='''[[Shortwave radiation]]'''}}{{defn|defn=Shortwave radiation (SW) is [[radiant energy]] with wavelengths in the [[Optical spectrum|visible]] (VIS), near-[[ultraviolet]] (UV), and [[near-infrared]] (NIR) spectra.

There is no standard cut-off for the near-infrared range; therefore, the shortwave radiation range is also variously defined. It may be broadly defined to include all radiation with a wavelength of 0.1[[μm]] and 5.0μm or narrowly defined so as to include only radiation between 0.2μm and 3.0μm.

There is little radiation flux (in terms of [[Irradiance|W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]]) to the Earth's surface below 0.2μm or above 3.0μm, although photon flux remains significant as far as 6.0μm, compared to shorter wavelength fluxes.  [[UV-C]] radiation spans from 0.1μm to .28μm, [[UV-B]] from 0.28μm to 0.315μm, [[UV-A]] from 0.315μm to 0.4μm, the visible spectrum from 0.4μm to 0.7μm, and [[near-infrared|NIR]] arguably from 0.7μm to 5.0μm, beyond which the infrared is thermal.&lt;ref&gt;However, the definition of thermal infrared may start at wavelengths as short as 1.1μm (longer than which optical instruments have difficulty measuring) or anywhere between 2.0μm and 4.0μm, depending on the method of measurement and its purpose.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{term|term='''[[Stefan–Boltzmann law]]'''}}{{defn|defn=The Stefan–Boltzmann law describes the power radiated from a [[black body]] in terms of its [[thermodynamic temperature|temperature]].  Specifically, the Stefan–Boltzmann law states that the total [[energy]] radiated per unit [[area|surface area]] of a [[black body]] across [[Black-body radiation#Spectrum|all wavelengths]] per unit [[time]] &lt;math&gt; j^{\star}&lt;/math&gt; (also known as the black-body ''[[radiant emittance]]'') is directly [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the fourth power of the black body's [[thermodynamic temperature]] ''T'':
: &lt;math&gt; j^{\star} = \sigma T^{4}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[constant of proportionality]] ''σ'', called the [[Stefan–Boltzmann constant]], is derived from other known [[physical constant]]s. [[2019 revision of the SI|Since 2019]], the value of the constant is
: &lt;math&gt;
\sigma=\frac{2\pi^5 k^4}{15c^2h^3} = 5.670374\ldots\times 10^{-8}\, \mathrm{W\, m^{-2}\,K^{-4}},
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''k'' is the [[Boltzmann constant]], ''h'' is the [[Planck constant]], and ''c'' is [[the speed of light in vacuum]]. The [[radiance]] from a specified angle of view (watts per square metre per [[steradian]]) is given by
: &lt;math&gt; L = \frac{j^{\star}}\pi = \frac\sigma\pi T^{4}.&lt;/math&gt;

A body that does not absorb all incident radiation (sometimes known as a grey body) emits less total energy than a black body and is characterized by an [[emissivity]], &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;:
: &lt;math&gt; j^{\star} = \varepsilon\sigma T^{4}.&lt;/math&gt;

The radiant emittance &lt;math&gt; j^{\star}&lt;/math&gt; has [[dimensional analysis#Definition|dimensions]] of [[energy flux]] (energy per unit time per unit area), and the [[SI units]] of measure are [[joule]]s per second per square metre, or equivalently, [[watt]]s per square metre. The SI unit for absolute temperature ''T'' is the [[kelvin]].  &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is the [[emissivity]] of the grey body; if it is a perfect blackbody, &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon=1&lt;/math&gt;. In the still more general (and realistic) case, the emissivity depends on the wavelength, &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon=\varepsilon(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt;.

To find the total [[Power (physics)|power]] radiated from an object, multiply by its surface area, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;:
: &lt;math&gt; P= A j^{\star} = A \varepsilon\sigma T^{4}.&lt;/math&gt;

The quest for the underlying causes of valence led to the modern theories of chemical bonding, including the [[cubical atom]] (1902), [[Lewis structure]]s (1916), [[valence bond theory]] (1927), [[molecular orbital]]s (1928), [[valence shell electron pair repulsion theory]] (1958), and all of the advanced methods of [[quantum chemistry]].}}

{{term|term='''[[van der Waals equation]]'''}}{{defn|defn=In [[chemistry]] and [[thermodynamics]], the Van der Waals equation (or ''Van der Waals equation of state''; named after Dutch physicist [[Johannes Diderik van der Waals]]) is an [[equation of state]] that generalizes the [[ideal gas law]] based on plausible reasons that [[real gas]]es do not act [[Idealization (science philosophy)|ideally]]. The ideal gas law treats gas [[molecule]]s as [[point particle]]s that interact with their containers but not each other, meaning they neither take up space nor change [[kinetic energy]] during [[collision]]s (i.e. all collisions are [[Elastic collision|perfectly elastic]]).&lt;ref name=PhysicalChemistry&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Robert J. | last1 = Silbey | first2 = Robert A. | last2 = Alberty | first3 = Moungi G. | last3 = Bawendi | title = Physical Chemistry | edition = 4th | year = 2004 | publisher = Wiley | isbn = 978-0471215042}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ideal gas law states that [[volume]] (''V'') occupied by ''n'' [[Mole (unit)|moles]] of any gas has a [[pressure]] (''P'') at [[temperature]] (''T'') in [[kelvin]]s&lt;!-- lower-case and pluralized – see Kelvin#Usage conventions --&gt; given by the following relationship, where ''R'' is the [[gas constant]]:
: &lt;math&gt;PV=nRT&lt;/math&gt;

To account for [[Molecular volume|the volume]] that a real gas molecule takes up, the Van der Waals equation replaces ''V'' in the ideal gas law with &lt;math&gt;(V_m-b)&lt;/math&gt;, where ''V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[molar volume]] of the gas and ''b'' is the volume that is occupied by one mole of the molecules. This leads to:&lt;ref name=PhysicalChemistry /&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;P(V_m - b)=R T&lt;/math&gt;

The second modification made to the ideal gas law accounts for the fact that gas molecules do in fact interact with each other (they usually experience attraction at low pressures and repulsion at high pressures) and that real gases therefore show different compressibility than ideal gases. Van der Waals provided for [[intermolecular interaction]] by adding to the observed pressure ''P'' in the equation of state a term &lt;math&gt;a /V_m^2&lt;/math&gt;, where ''a'' is a constant whose value depends on the gas. The ''Van der Waals equation'' is therefore written as:&lt;ref name=PhysicalChemistry /&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\left(P+a\frac1{V_m^2}\right)(V_m-b)=R T&lt;/math&gt;
and, for ''n'' moles of gas, can also be written as the equation below:
: &lt;math&gt;\left(P+a \frac{n^2}{V^2}\right)(V-n b)=n R T&lt;/math&gt;
where ''V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the molar volume of the gas, ''R'' is the universal gas constant, ''T'' is temperature, ''P'' is pressure, and ''V'' is volume. When the molar volume ''V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' is large, ''b'' becomes negligible in comparison with ''V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''a/V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' becomes negligible with respect to ''P'', and the Van der Waals equation reduces to the ideal gas law, ''PV&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;=RT''.&lt;ref name=PhysicalChemistry /&gt;

It is available via its traditional derivation (a mechanical equation of state), or via a derivation based in [[statistical thermodynamics]], the latter of which provides the [[partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]] of the system and allows thermodynamic functions to be specified. It successfully approximates the behavior of real [[fluid]]s above their [[critical temperature]]s and is qualitatively reasonable for their [[liquid]] and low-pressure [[gas]]eous states at low temperatures. However, near the [[phase transition]]s between gas and liquid, in the range of ''p'', ''V'', and ''T'' where the liquid phase and the gas phase are in [[Thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]], the Van der Waals equation fails to accurately model observed experimental behaviour, in particular that ''p'' is a constant function of ''V'' at given temperatures. As such, the Van der Waals model is not useful only for calculations intended to predict real behavior in regions near the [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]]. Corrections to address these predictive deficiencies have since been made, such as the [[#Maxwell equal area rule|equal area rule]] or the [[principle of corresponding states]].}}

For most non-[[electrolyte]]s dissolved in water, the Van&amp;nbsp;'t Hoff factor is essentially 1. For most [[ionic compound]]s dissolved in water, the Van&amp;nbsp;'t Hoff factor is equal to the number of discrete ions in a [[formula unit]] of the substance. This is true for [[ideal solution]]s only, as occasionally [[ion pair]]ing occurs in solution. At a given instant a small percentage of the ions are paired and count as a single particle. Ion pairing occurs to some extent in all electrolyte solutions. This causes the measured Van&amp;nbsp;'t Hoff factor to be less than that predicted in an ideal solution.

Phys., vol. 1, pp. 582–592.&lt;/ref&gt; It is part of plasticity theory that applies best to [[ductile]] materials, such as some metals. Prior to yield, material response can be assumed to be of a nonlinear elastic, viscoelastic, or linear elastic behavior.

In [[materials science]] and [[engineering]] the von Mises yield criterion can also be formulated in terms of the ''von Mises stress'' or ''equivalent tensile stress'', &lt;math&gt;\sigma_v&lt;/math&gt;. This is a scalar value of stress that can be computed from the [[Cauchy stress tensor]]. In this case, a material is said to start yielding when the von Mises stress reaches a value known as [[yield strength]], &lt;math&gt;\sigma_y&lt;/math&gt;. The von Mises stress is used to predict yielding of materials under complex loading from the results of uniaxial tensile tests. The von Mises stress satisfies the property where two stress states with equal distortion energy have an equal von Mises stress.}}

The first edition of WED in 2019, as well as the following ones, were based on the concept of holding simultaneous online and on-site celebrations, hosted by UNESCO, WFEO, engineering institutions members of WFEO, as well as generating social media trends and message on the theme of event, engaging with UN agencies such as [[UNEP]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archives1.sundayobserver.lk/2022/05/29/only-one-earth|title=Only One Earth|date=March 4, 2022|website=Sunday Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt; corporate bodies, other associations, media and students.

In 2022, the concept extended to a 24-hour streaming hosted by WFEO, live streaming featured celebrations in various regions of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.myjoyonline.com/ghana-hosts-world-engineering-day-live-stream-for-africa/ |lang=en |title=Ghana hosts World Engineering Day live stream for Africa |website=myjoyonline.com |accessdate=2023-04-07 |date=8 March 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/i/web/status/149834377387256628|title=Tweet from Royal Academy of Engineering|website=Twitter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FRP is used broadly across various disciplines, particularly in [[information retrieval]], [[database management]], and [[pattern recognition]], which efficiently processes large sets of objects through a two-stage approach: filtering and refinement.

The filtering stage quickly eliminates less promising or irrelevant objects from a large set using efficient, less resource-intensive algorithms. This stage is designed to reduce the volume of data that needs to be processed in the more resource-demanding refinement stage.

Following filtering, the refinement stage applies more complex and computationally expensive techniques to the remaining objects to achieve higher accuracy via finer-grained processing. This stage is essential for obtaining the desired quality and precision in the results.

FRP is a general method for completing a computationally intensive task as quickly as possible ([https://www.researchgate.net/publication/249590687_Filter_and_Refine_Strategy Filter and Refine Strategy]),  which is important in scenarios where managing the inherent trade-offs between speed and accuracy is crucial. Its implementations span various fields and applications, from [[database index]]ing/query processing, and [[information retrieval]] to [[machine learning]] and [[big data]] analytics. Its implementation helps in optimizing systems to better manage the inherent trade-offs between speed and accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Abel |first1=David J. |last2=Gaede |first2=Volker |last3=Power |first3=Robert A. |last4=Zhou |first4=Xiaofang |title=Caching strategies for spatial joins |journal=GeoInformatica |volume=3 |pages=33–59 |year=1999 |issue=1 |doi=10.1023/A:1009844729517 |bibcode=1999GInfo...3...33A |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1009844729517|url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

FRP follows a two-step processing strategy:

# Filter: an efficient filter function &lt;math&gt;f_{filter}&lt;/math&gt; is applied to each object &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in the dataset &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;. The filtered subset &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}'&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}' = \{x | f_{filter}(x) \ge v\} &lt;/math&gt; for value-based tasks, where &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is a threshold value, or &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}' = \{x | f_{filter}(x) = v\} &lt;/math&gt; for type-based tasks, where &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the target type(s).
# Refine: a more complex refinement function &lt;math&gt;f_{refine}&lt;/math&gt; is applied to each object &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}'&lt;/math&gt;, resulting in the set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R} = \{x | f_{refine(x)} \ge v\}&lt;/math&gt;, or likewise, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R} = \{x | f_{refine(x)} = v\}&lt;/math&gt;, as the final output.

This strategy balances the trade-offs between processing speed and accuracy, which is crucial in situations where resources such as time, memory, or computation are limited.

== Applications in Specific Fields ==

=== Reinforcement Learning ===

In the domain of [[artificial intelligence]], [[Reinforcement Learning]] (RL) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Sutton |first1=Richard S. |last2=Barto |first2=Andrew G. |title=Reinforcement learning: An introduction |publisher=MIT press |year=2018 |url=https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209/Readings/SuttonBartoIPRLBook2ndEd.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrates the Filter and Refine Principle (FRP) through the processes of ''policy'' and ''value function'' estimation. In RL, agents learn to make decisions by exploring the ''environment'' and receiving feedback in the form of ''rewards''. For example, in [[AlphaZero]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Silver |first1=David |last2=Schrittwieser |first2=Julian |last3=Simonyan |first3=Karen |last4=Antonoglou |first4=Ioannis |last5=Huang |first5=Aja |last6=Guez |first6=Arthur |last7=Hubert |first7=Thomas |last8=Baker |first8=Lucas |last9=Lai |first9=Matthew |last10=Bolton |first10=Adrian |last11=Chen |first11=Yutian |last12=Lillicrap |first12=Timothy |last13=Hui |first13=Fan |last14=Sifre |first14=Laurent |last15=van den Driessche |first15=George |last16=Graepel |first16=Thore |last17=Hassabis |first17=Demis |title=Mastering the game of go without human knowledge |journal=Nature |volume=550 |issue=7676 |pages=354–359 |year=2017 |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24270}}&lt;/ref&gt; the filtering stage in RL involves narrowing down the set of possible actions at each state by using a policy network, which predicts potentially rewarding ''actions'' based on previous ''experiences''. This approach reduces the ''search space'' significantly, enabling more efficient [[learning]] processes.

The refinement stage in RL involves more detailed simulations or deeper analysis through techniques like [[Monte Carlo tree search]] (MCTS) or [[temporal difference learning]], which refine the policy and value estimates to optimize long-term rewards. This step is crucial for fine-tuning the strategy to achieve optimal performance, particularly in complex environments where numerous possible actions and outcomes exist. RL's application of FRP is critical in scenarios requiring both quick decision-making and high accuracy, such as in [[autonomous vehicles]] and gaming.

=== Mixture of Experts ===

The [[mixture of experts]] (MoE) is a [[machine learning]] paradigm that incorporates FRP by dividing a complex problem into simpler, manageable sub-tasks, each handled by a specialized ''expert''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Shazeer |first1=Noam |last2=Mirhoseini |first2=Azalia |last3=Maziarz |first3=Krzysztof |last4=Davis |first4=Andy |last5=Le |first5=Quoc |last6=Hinton |first6=Geoffrey |last7=Dean |first7=Jeff |title=Outrageously large neural networks: The sparsely-gated mixture-of-experts layer |arxiv=1701.06538 |year=2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the filtering stage, a gating mechanism—acting as a filter that determines the most suitable expert for each specific part of the input data based on the data's characteristics. This stage is critical as it allows the system to allocate resources more efficiently by engaging only the most relevant experts for each task.

During the refinement stage, each chosen expert applies its specialized knowledge to process the input more thoroughly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Lin |first1=Bin |last2=Tang |first2=Zhenyu |last3=Ye |first3=Yang |last4=Cui |first4=Jiaxi |last5=Zhu |first5=Bin |last6=Jin |first6=Peng |last7=Huang |first7=Jinfa |last8=Zhang |first8=Junwu |last9=Ning |first9=Munan |last10=Yuan |first10=Li |title=MoE-LLaVA: Mixture of experts for large vision-language models|arxiv=2401.15947 |year=2024 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach enhances the overall system's performance by combining the strengths of various experts tailored to different aspects of the data. The refinement ensures that each segment of the input is processed optimally, leading to improved accuracy and adaptability of the model across diverse scenarios. MoE models are particularly effective in tasks where different types of expertise are beneficial, such as in complex decision-making systems and large-scale [[classification]] problems.

=== Cascading Classifiers ===

[[Cascading classifiers]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Viola |first1=Paul |last2=Jones |first2=Michael |title=Rapid object detection using a boosted cascade of simple features |conference=IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition |publisher=IEEE |volume=1 |year=2001 |doi=10.1109/CVPR.2001.990517 |url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/990517|url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[computer vision]] exemplify the Filter and Refine Principle (FRP) by employing a hierarchical arrangement of classifiers, each increasing in complexity and precision. Initial classifiers quickly filter out clearly irrelevant data, significantly reducing the dataset's volume for processing by subsequent stages. This early filtering allows for a rapid reduction in data size, streamlining the process.

As the dataset moves through each stage of the cascade, the remaining data becomes progressively smaller and consists of increasingly complex cases. Later classifiers refine the decisions by focusing intensively on these challenging cases, ensuring high accuracy while minimizing computational demands. This technique is especially effective in real-time scenarios such as [[face detection]] in [[video streams]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Lienhart |first1=Rainer |last2=Maydt |first2=Jochen |title=An extended set of haar-like features for rapid object detection |conference=International Conference on Image Processing |volume=1 |publisher=IEEE |year=2002 |doi=10.1109/ICIP.2002.1038171 |url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1038171|url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt; where fast processing is critical. The cascading approach not only accelerates processing speeds but also enhances the system's capability to manage complex tasks efficiently under tight resource constraints.

=== Query Processing ===

[[database|Query processing]] in large [[databases]] and [[information retrieval]] systems frequently employ the FRP to handle vast amounts of data efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Chaudhuri |first=Surajit |title=An overview of query optimization in relational systems |conference=ACM SIGACT-SIGMOD-SIGART Symposium on Principles of Database Systems |year=1998 |url=https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs345d-01/rl/chaudhuri98.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, a query processor filters data through mechanisms like [[query optimization]], where queries are reformulated and simplified to reduce the computational cost. This process might involve selecting the most efficient [[query plan]] or utilizing statistical estimates to quickly prune large data sections that do not match the query criteria. This initial filtering stage is crucial to ensure that the system uses its resources effectively, preparing the ground for more detailed examination. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Graefe |first=Goetz |title=Query evaluation techniques for large databases |journal=ACM Computing Surveys |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=73–169 |year=1993 |doi=10.1145/152610.152611 |url=https://doi.org/10.1145/152610.152611}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, techniques such as [[iDistance | iDistance]] exemplify this approach by first filtering candidate points in high-dimensional spaces and then refining the results through exact distance calculations.

In the refinement stage of query processing, the system performs a detailed execution of the chosen [[query plan]]. This involves accessing the actual data, applying more complex filters, and performing operations such as joins, aggregations, and sorts on the narrowed-down data set. This stage refines the results to meet the query's exact specifications, ensuring high precision and relevance. This dual-stage processing is fundamental in environments with large, complex data sets where performance and accuracy are critical, such as in [[online transaction processing]] systems and large-scale analytical queries.

== History and Development ==

The principles underlying FRP can be traced back to early efforts in optimizing database systems. The principle is the main optimization strategy of indices,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; where indices serve as a means to retrieve a subset of data quickly without scanning a large portion of the database, and do a thorough check on the subset of data upon retrieval. The core idea is to reduce both disk I/O and computational cost. The principle is used in query processing and data intensive applications. For example, in Jack A. Orenstein's 1986 SIGMOD paper, “Spatial Query Processing in an Object-Oriented Database System,”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Orenstein |first1=Jack A.  |title=Spatial Query Processing in an Object-Oriented Database System |conference=Proceedings of the 1986 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data |year=1986 |publisher=ACM}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed concepts related to FRP as the study explores efficient methods for spatial query processing within databases.
Further formalization of FRP was explicitly proposed in the 1999 paper by Ho-Hyun Park et al., “Early Separation of Filter and Refinement Steps in Spatial Query Optimization”.&lt;ref name="1999paper"/&gt;
This paper systematically applied the FRP strategy to enhance spatial query optimization, marking a significant point in the history of FRP's application in computational tasks.

The Filter and Refine Principle (FRP) has been a cornerstone in the evolution of computational systems. Its origins can be traced back to early computing practices where efficiency and resource management were critical, leading to the development of algorithms and systems that implicitly used FRP-like strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Stonebraker |first1=Michael |last2=Hachem |first2=Nabil |last3=Helland |first3=Pat |title=The end of an architectural era: It's time for a complete rewrite |publisher=CSAIL |year=2018 |pages=463–489 |url=http://nms.csail.mit.edu/~stavros/pubs/hstore.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the decades, as computational resources expanded and the complexity of tasks increased, the need for formalizing such a principle became evident. This led to a more structured application of FRP across various domains,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Patterson |first=David A. |title=Latency lags bandwidth |journal=Communications of the ACM |volume=47 |issue=10 |pages=71–75 |year=2004 |doi=10.1145/1022594.1022596 |url=https://cacm.acm.org/research/latency-lags-bandwidth/|url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dean |first1=Jeffrey |last2=Ghemawat |first2=Sanjay |title=MapReduce: simplified data processing on large clusters |journal=Communications of the ACM |volume=51 |issue=1 |pages=107–113 |year=2008 |doi=10.1145/1327452.1327492 |url=https://doi.org/10.1145/1327452.1327492}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[databases]] and [[operating system]]s to [[Network planning and design|network design]] and [[machine learning]], where trade-offs between speed and accuracy are continuously managed.

FRP as a distinct principle has been increasingly cited in academic literature and industry practices as systems face growing volumes of data and demand for [[Real-time computing|real-time processing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jordan |first1=M. I. |last2=Mitchell |first2=T. M. |title=Machine learning: Trends, perspectives, and prospects |journal=Science |volume=349 |issue=6245 |pages=255–260 |year=2015 |doi=10.1126/science.aaa8415 |pmid=26185243 |bibcode=2015Sci...349..255J |url=https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaa8415|url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt; This recognition is a testament to the evolving nature of technology and the need for frameworks that can adaptively manage the dual demands of efficiency and precision. Today, FRP is integral to the design of scalable systems that require handling large datasets efficiently, ensuring that it remains relevant in the era of big data, artificial intelligence, and beyond.

'''Catalytic computing''' is a technique in [[computer science]], relevant to [[Computational complexity theory|complexity theory]], that uses full memory, as well as empty memory space, to perform computations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Brubaker |first=Ben |date=2025-02-18 |title=Catalytic Computing Taps the Full Power of a Full Hard Drive |url=https://www.quantamagazine.org/catalytic-computing-taps-the-full-power-of-a-full-hard-drive-20250218/ |access-date=2025-02-22 |website=Quanta Magazine |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Buhrman |first1=Harry |last2=Cleve |first2=Richard |last3=Koucký |first3=Michal |last4=Loff |first4=Bruno |last5=Speelman |first5=Florian |chapter=Computing with a full memory: Catalytic space |date=2014-05-31 |title=Proceedings of the forty-sixth annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing |chapter-url=https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2591796.2591874 |series=STOC '14 |location=New York, NY, USA |publisher=Association for Computing Machinery |pages=857–866 |doi=10.1145/2591796.2591874 |isbn=978-1-4503-2710-7|url=https://ir.cwi.nl/pub/22659 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Full memory is memory that begins in an arbitrary state and must be returned to that state at the end of the computation, for example important data.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It can sometimes be used to reduce the [[Computer memory|memory]] needs of certain algorithms, for example the [[tree evaluation problem]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It was defined by Buhrman, Cleve, Koucký, Loff, and Speelman in 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Buhrman |first1=Harry |last2=Koucký |first2=Michal |last3=Loff |first3=Bruno |last4=Speelman |first4=Florian |date=2018-01-01 |title=Catalytic Space: Non-determinism and Hierarchy |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00224-017-9784-7 |journal=Theory of Computing Systems |language=en |volume=62 |issue=1 |pages=116–135 |doi=10.1007/s00224-017-9784-7 |issn=1433-0490}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was named after [[Catalysis|catalysts]] in chemistry, based on the metaphorically viewing the full memory as a "catalyst", a non-consumed factor critical for the computational "reaction" to succeed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The complexity class CSPACE(s(n)) is the class of sets computable by catalytic Turing machines whose work tape is bounded by s(n) tape cells and whose auxiliary full memory space is bounded by &lt;math&gt;2^{s(n)}&lt;/math&gt; tape cells.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It has been shown that CSPACE(log(n)), or catalytic logspace, is contained within [[ZPP (complexity)|ZPP]] and, importantly, contains [[TC (complexity)|TC&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Results ==
In 2020 J. Cook and Mertz used catalytic computing to prove to attack the tree evaluation problem (TreeEval) a type of [[pebble game]] introduced by [[Stephen Cook|Cook]], McKenzie, Wehr, [[Mark Braverman (mathematician)|Braverman]] and Santhanam as an example where any algorithm for solving the problem would require too much memory to belong in the [[L (complexity)|'''L''' complexity class]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Cook |first1=Stephen |last2=McKenzie |first2=Pierre |last3=Wehr |first3=Dustin |last4=Braverman |first4=Mark |last5=Santhanam |first5=Rahul |date=2012 |title=Pebbles and Branching Programs for Tree Evaluation |url=https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2077336.2077337 |journal=ACM Transactions on Computation Theory |language=en |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=1–43 |arxiv=1005.2642 |doi=10.1145/2077336.2077337 |issn=1942-3454}}&lt;/ref&gt; proving that in fact the conjectured minimum can be lowered&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Cook |first1=James |last2=Mertz |first2=Ian |chapter=Catalytic approaches to the tree evaluation problem |date=2020-06-22 |title=Proceedings of the 52nd Annual ACM SIGACT Symposium on Theory of Computing |chapter-url=https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3357713.3384316 |language=en |publisher=ACM |pages=752–760 |doi=10.1145/3357713.3384316 |isbn=978-1-4503-6979-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Cook |first1=James |title=Catalytic Approaches to the Tree Evaluation Problem |date=2020-04-26 |url=https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2020/056/ |access-date=2025-05-21 |publisher=Electronic Colloquium on Computational Complexity |language=en |id=TR20-056 |last2=Mertz |first2=Ian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2023 they lowered the bound even further to space &lt;math&gt;O(\log n \log\log n)&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Cook |first1=James |last2=Mertz |first2=Ian |chapter=Tree Evaluation is in Space 𝑂 (Log 𝑛 · log log 𝑛) |date=2024-06-10 |title=Proceedings of the 56th Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing |chapter-url=https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3618260.3649664 |language=en |publisher=ACM |pages=1268–1278 |doi=10.1145/3618260.3649664 |isbn=979-8-4007-0383-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; almost ruling out the problem as an approach to the question if '''L'''='''P'''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The theory of computation concerns abstract [[models of computation]] and general classes of [[computational problem|problems]] that can be solved using them. The fields of [[cryptography]] and [[computer security]] involve studying the means for secure communication and preventing [[security vulnerabilities]]. [[Computer graphics (computer science)|Computer graphics]] and [[computational geometry]] address the generation of images. [[Programming language theory]] considers different ways to describe computational processes, and [[database]] theory concerns the management of repositories of data. [[Human–computer interaction]] investigates the interfaces through which humans and computers interact, and software engineering focuses on the design and principles behind developing software. Areas such as [[operating system]]s, [[Computer network|network]]s and [[embedded system]]s investigate the principles and design behind [[complex system]]s. Computer architecture describes the construction of computer components and computer-operated equipment. [[Artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] aim to synthesize goal-orientated processes such as problem-solving, decision-making, environmental adaptation, [[Automated planning and scheduling|planning]] and learning found in humans and animals. Within artificial intelligence, [[computer vision]] aims to understand and process image and video data, while [[natural language processing]] aims to understand and process textual and linguistic data.

The fundamental concern of computer science is determining what can and cannot be automated.&lt;ref name=MITAutomated/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Patton |first1=Richard D. |date=2009 |url=https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-78831-7_18 |work=Springer Handbook of Automation |pages=305–313 |editor-last=Nof |editor-first=Shimon Y. |series=Springer Handbooks |place=Berlin, Heidelberg |publisher=Springer |language=en |doi=10.1007/978-3-540-78831-7_18 |isbn=978-3-540-78831-7 |access-date=2022-03-03 |last2=Patton |first2=Peter C. |title=What Can be Automated?

The earliest foundations of what would become computer science predate the invention of the modern [[digital computer]].

In 1820, [[Thomas de Colmar]] launched the mechanical calculator industry&lt;ref group=note&gt;In 1851&lt;/ref&gt; when he invented his simplified [[arithmometer]], the first calculating machine strong enough and reliable enough to be used daily in an office environment. [[Charles Babbage]] started the design of the first ''automatic mechanical calculator'', his [[Difference Engine]], in 1822, which eventually gave him the idea of the first ''programmable mechanical calculator'', his [[Analytical Engine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Science Museum, Babbage's Analytical Engine, 1834–1871 (Trial model)|url=https://collection.sciencemuseumgroup.org.uk/objects/co62245/babbages-analytical-engine-1834-1871-trial-model-analytical-engines|access-date=2020-05-11|archive-date=August 30, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190830123359/https://collection.sciencemuseumgroup.org.uk/objects/co62245/babbages-analytical-engine-1834-1871-trial-model-analytical-engines|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started developing this machine in 1834, and "in less than two years, he had sketched out many of the [[wikt:Special:Search/salient|salient]] features of the modern computer".&lt;ref name="Hyman1982"&gt;{{cite book|first=Anthony|last=Hyman|author-link=R.

[[#COLLIER|Bruce Collier]], 1970&lt;/ref&gt; In 1843, during the translation of a French article on the Analytical Engine, [[Ada Lovelace]] wrote, in one of the many notes she included, an algorithm to compute the [[Bernoulli number]]s, which is considered to be the first published algorithm ever specifically tailored for implementation on a computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottlan.edu/Lriddle/women/ada-love.htm |title=A Selection and Adaptation From Ada's Notes found in Ada, The Enchantress of Numbers," by Betty Alexandra Toole Ed.D.

In 1914, the Spanish engineer [[Leonardo Torres Quevedo]] published his ''Essays on Automatics'',&lt;ref name="LTQ1914es"&gt;Torres Quevedo, L. (1914). "Ensayos sobre Automática – Su definicion. Extension teórica de sus aplicaciones". ''Revista de la Academia de Ciencias Exacta'', 12, pp. 391–418.&lt;/ref&gt; and designed, inspired by Babbage, a theoretical electromechanical calculating machine which was to be controlled by a read-only program. The paper also introduced the idea of [[floating-point arithmetic]].&lt;ref&gt;Torres Quevedo, Leonardo.

When the machine was finished, some hailed it as "Babbage's dream come true".&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFRandell1973|Brian Randell]], p. 187, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1940s, with the development of new and more powerful [[computing]] machines such as the [[Atanasoff–Berry computer]] and [[ENIAC]], the term ''computer'' came to refer to the machines rather than their human predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM) was founded in 1947.&lt;/ref&gt; As it became clear that computers could be used for more than just mathematical calculations, the field of computer science broadened to study [[computation]] in general. In 1945, IBM founded the [[Watson Scientific Computing Laboratory]] at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City]]. The renovated fraternity house on Manhattan's West Side was IBM's first laboratory devoted to pure science.

His efforts, and those of others such as [[numerical analyst]] [[George Forsythe]], were rewarded: universities went on to create such departments, starting with Purdue in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Knuth]] (1972). ''[http://www.stanford.edu/dept/ICME/docs/history/forsythe_knuth.pdf "George Forsythe and the Development of Computer Science"]''. ''Comms.

Because of this, several alternative names have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Matti Tedre |year=2006 |url=http://epublications.uef.fi/pub/urn_isbn_952-458-867-6/urn_isbn_952-458-867-6.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/http://epublications.uef.fi/pub/urn_isbn_952-458-867-6/urn_isbn_952-458-867-6.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live |title=The Development of Computer Science: A Sociocultural Perspective |page=260 |access-date=December 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain departments of major universities prefer the term ''computing science'', to emphasize precisely that difference. Danish scientist [[Peter Naur]] suggested the term ''datalogy'',&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to reflect the fact that the scientific discipline revolves around data and data treatment, while not necessarily involving computers. The first scientific institution to use the term was the Department of Datalogy at the University of Copenhagen, founded in 1969, with Peter Naur being the first professor in datalogy. The term is used mainly in the Scandinavian countries. An alternative term, also proposed by Naur, is [[data science]]; this is now used for a [[multi-disciplinary]] field of data analysis, including statistics and databases.

In the early days of computing, a number of terms for the practitioners of the field of computing were suggested (albeit facetiously) in the ''Communications of the ACM''—''turingineer'', ''turologist'', ''flow-charts-man'', ''applied meta-mathematician'', and ''applied [[epistemologist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=&lt;!-- missing! --&gt; |volume=1 |issue=4 |page=6| doi = 10.1145/368796.368802|last1=Weiss |first1=E.A. |title=Letters to the editor |journal= Communications of the ACM |last2=Corley |first2=Henry P.T. |s2cid=5379449 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three months later in the same journal, ''comptologist'' was suggested, followed next year by ''hypologist''.&lt;ref&gt;Communications of the ACM 2(1):p.4&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''computics'' has also been suggested.&lt;ref&gt;IEEE Computer 28(12): p.136&lt;/ref&gt; {{anchor|Name of the field in Europe}}In Europe, terms derived from contracted translations of the expression "automatic information" (e.g. "{{lang|it|informazione automatica}}" in Italian) or "information and mathematics" are often used, e.g. {{lang|fr|informatique}} (French), {{lang|de|Informatik}} (German), {{lang|it|informatica}} (Italian, Dutch), {{lang|es|informática}} (Spanish, Portuguese), {{lang|sla|informatika}} ([[Slavic languages]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]) or {{lang|el-latn|pliroforiki}} ({{lang|el|πληροφορική|italic=no}}, which means informatics) in [[Greek language|Greek]].

A folkloric quotation, often attributed to—but almost certainly not first formulated by—[[Edsger Dijkstra]], states that "computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes."&lt;ref group=note&gt;See the entry
"[[q:Computer science|Computer science]]" on Wikiquote for the history of this quotation.&lt;/ref&gt; The design and deployment of computers and computer systems is generally considered the province of disciplines other than computer science. For example, the study of computer hardware is usually considered part of [[computer engineering]], while the study of commercial [[computer system]]s and their deployment is often called information technology or [[information system]]s. However, there has been exchange of ideas between the various computer-related disciplines. Computer science research also often intersects other disciplines, such as [[cognitive science]], [[computational linguistics|linguistics]], [[mathematics]], [[physics]], [[biology]], [[Earth science]], [[computational statistics|statistics]], [[philosophy]], and [[logic]].

Computer science is considered by some to have a much closer relationship with mathematics than many scientific disciplines, with some observers saying that computing is a mathematical science.&lt;ref name=Denning/&gt; Early computer science was strongly influenced by the work of mathematicians such as [[Kurt Gödel]], [[Alan Turing]], [[John von Neumann]], [[Rózsa Péter]] and [[Alonzo Church]] and there continues to be a useful interchange of ideas between the two fields in areas such as [[mathematical logic]], [[category theory]], [[domain theory]], and [[algebra]].&lt;ref name="Tedre2014"/&gt;

The relationship between computer science and software engineering is a contentious issue, which is further muddied by [[Software engineering#Suitability|disputes]] over what the term "software engineering" means, and how computer science is defined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Tedre | first1 = M. | title = Computing as a Science: A Survey of Competing Viewpoints | doi = 10.1007/s11023-011-9240-4 | journal = Minds and Machines | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 361–387 | year = 2011 | s2cid = 14263916 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Parnas]], taking a cue from the relationship between other engineering and science disciplines, has claimed that the principal focus of computer science is studying the properties of computation in general, while the principal focus of software engineering is the design of specific computations to achieve practical goals, making the two separate but complementary disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Parnas | first1 = D.L. | journal = Annals of Software Engineering | volume = 6 | pages = 19–37 | year = 1998 | doi = 10.1023/A:1018949113292|title=Software engineering programmes are not computer science programmes| s2cid = 35786237 }}, p. 19: "Rather than treat software engineering as a subfield of computer science, I treat it as an element of the set, Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, [...]"&lt;/ref&gt;

The academic, political, and funding aspects of computer science tend to depend on whether a department is formed with a mathematical emphasis or with an engineering emphasis. Computer science departments with a mathematics emphasis and with a numerical orientation consider alignment with [[computational science]]. Both types of departments tend to make efforts to bridge the field educationally if not across all research.

Simon]] argued in 1975, {{Blockquote|text =Computer science is an empirical discipline. We would have called it an experimental science, but like astronomy, economics, and geology, some of its unique forms of observation and experience do not fit a narrow stereotype of the experimental method. Nonetheless, they are experiments. Each new machine that is built is an experiment. Actually constructing the machine poses a question to nature; and we listen for the answer by observing the machine in operation and analyzing it by all analytical and measurement means available.&lt;ref name = "plato"/&gt;}} It has since been argued that computer science can be classified as an empirical science since it makes use of empirical testing to evaluate the [[Correctness (computer science)|correctness of programs]], but a problem remains in defining the laws and theorems of computer science (if any exist) and defining the nature of experiments in computer science.&lt;ref name = "plato"/&gt; Proponents of classifying computer science as an engineering discipline argue that the reliability of computational systems is investigated in the same way as bridges in [[civil engineering]] and airplanes in [[aerospace engineering]].&lt;ref name = "plato"/&gt; They also argue that while empirical sciences observe what presently exists, computer science observes what is possible to exist and while scientists discover laws from observation, no proper laws have been found in computer science and it is instead concerned with creating phenomena.&lt;ref name = "plato"/&gt;

A number of computer scientists have argued for the distinction of three separate paradigms in computer science. [[Peter Wegner (computer scientist)|Peter Wegner]] argued that those paradigms are science, technology, and mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |author=Wegner, P. |title=Research paradigms in computer science—Proceedings of the 2nd international Conference on Software Engineering |location=San Francisco, California, United States |date=October 13–15, 1976 |publisher=IEEE Computer Society Press, Los Alamitos, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter J.

[[CSAB (professional organization)|CSAB]], formerly called Computing Sciences Accreditation Board—which is made up of representatives of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM), and the [[IEEE Computer Society]] (IEEE CS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csab.org/ |title=CSAB Leading Computer Education |publisher=CSAB |date=August 3, 2011 |access-date=19 November 2011 |archive-date=January 20, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190120190336/http://www.csab.org/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;—identifies four areas that it considers crucial to the discipline of computer science: ''theory of computation'', ''algorithms and data structures'', ''programming methodology and languages'', and ''computer elements and architecture''. In addition to these four areas, CSAB also identifies fields such as software engineering, artificial intelligence, computer networking and communication, database systems, parallel computation, distributed computation, human–computer interaction, computer graphics, operating systems, and numerical and [[symbolic computation]] as being important areas of computer science.&lt;ref name="CSAB1997"/&gt;

===Theoretical computer science===
{{main|Theoretical computer science}}
''Theoretical computer science'' is mathematical and abstract in spirit, but it derives its motivation from practical and everyday computation. It aims to understand the nature of computation and, as a consequence of this understanding, provide more efficient methodologies.

====Theory of computation====

{{main|Theory of computation}}

According to Peter Denning, the fundamental question underlying computer science is, "What can be automated?"&lt;ref name=DenningAutomated/&gt; Theory of computation is focused on answering fundamental questions about what can be computed and what amount of resources are required to perform those computations. In an effort to answer the first question, [[computability theory]] examines which computational problems are solvable on various theoretical [[models of computation]]. The second question is addressed by [[computational complexity theory]], which studies the time and space costs associated with different approaches to solving a multitude of computational problems.

The famous [[P = NP?]] problem, one of the [[Millennium Prize Problems]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.claymath.org/millennium/P_vs_NP/ Clay Mathematics Institute] P = NP {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014194456/http://www.claymath.org/millennium/P_vs_NP/ |date=October 14, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is an open problem in the theory of computation.

====Information and coding theory====

{{main|Information theory|Coding theory}}

Information theory, closely related to [[probability]] and [[statistics]], is related to the quantification of information. This was developed by [[Claude Shannon]] to find fundamental limits on [[signal processing]] operations such as compressing data and on reliably storing and communicating data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=October 14, 2002 |last=P. Collins |first=Graham |title=Claude E. Shannon: Founder of Information Theory |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=claude-e-shannon-founder |work=Scientific American |access-date=December 12, 2014 |archive-date=January 16, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116183558/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=claude-e-shannon-founder |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Coding theory is the study of the properties of [[code]]s (systems for converting information from one form to another) and their fitness for a specific application. Codes are used for [[data compression]], [[cryptography]], [[error detection and correction]], and more recently also for [[network coding]]. Codes are studied for the purpose of designing efficient and reliable [[data transmission]] methods.

====Programming language theory and formal methods====
{{main|Programming language theory|Formal methods}}
Programming language theory is a branch of computer science that deals with the design, implementation, analysis, characterization, and classification of [[programming language]]s and their individual [[Programming language#Elements|features]]. It falls within the discipline of computer science, both depending on and affecting mathematics, software engineering, and [[linguistics]]. It is an active research area, with numerous dedicated academic journals.

Formal methods are a particular kind of mathematically based technique for the [[formal specification|specification]], development and [[formal verification|verification]] of software and [[computer hardware|hardware]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;Phillip A. Laplante, (2010). ''Encyclopedia of Software Engineering'' Three-Volume Set (Print). CRC Press. p. 309. {{ISBN|978-1-351-24926-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of formal methods for software and hardware design is motivated by the expectation that, as in other engineering disciplines, performing appropriate mathematical analysis can contribute to the reliability and robustness of a design. They form an important theoretical underpinning for software engineering, especially where safety or security is involved. Formal methods are a useful adjunct to software testing since they help avoid errors and can also give a framework for testing. For industrial use, tool support is required. However, the high cost of using formal methods means that they are usually only used in the development of high-integrity and [[life-critical system]]s, where safety or [[computer security|security]] is of utmost importance. Formal methods are best described as the application of a fairly broad variety of [[theoretical computer science]] fundamentals, in particular [[logic in computer science|logic]] calculi, [[formal language]]s, [[automata theory]], and [[program semantics]], but also [[type systems]] and [[algebraic data types]] to problems in software and hardware specification and verification.

{{main|Computer graphics (computer science)}}
Computer graphics is the study of digital visual contents and involves the synthesis and manipulation of image data. The study is connected to many other fields in computer science, including [[computer vision]], [[image processing]], and [[computational geometry]], and is heavily applied in the fields of special effects and [[video game]]s.

====Image and sound processing====
{{main|Data processing}}
[[Information]] can take the form of images, sound, video or other multimedia. [[Bit]]s of information can be streamed via [[signal]]s. Its [[Data processing|processing]] is the central notion of informatics, the European view on computing, which studies information processing algorithms independently of the type of information carrier – whether it is electrical, mechanical or biological. This field plays important role in [[information theory]], [[telecommunications]], [[information engineering]] and has applications in [[medical image computing]] and [[speech synthesis]], among others. ''What is the lower bound on the complexity of [[fast Fourier transform]] algorithms?'' is one of the [[List of unsolved problems in computer science|unsolved problems in theoretical computer science]].

[[Scientific computing]] (or computational science) is the field of study concerned with constructing [[scientific modelling|mathematical models]] and [[numerical analysis|quantitative analysis]] techniques and using computers to analyze and solve [[scientific]] problems. A major usage of scientific computing is [[simulation]] of various processes, including computational [[fluid dynamics]], physical, electrical, and electronic systems and circuits, societies and social situations (notably war games) along with their habitats, and interactions among biological cells. Modern computers enable optimization of such designs as complete aircraft. Notable in electrical and electronic circuit design are SPICE,&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad H. Rashid, (2016). ''SPICE for Power Electronics and Electric Power''. CRC Press. p. 6. {{ISBN|978-1-4398-6047-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as software for physical realization of new (or modified) designs. The latter includes essential design software for [[integrated circuit]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=What is an integrated circuit (IC)?

====Human–computer interaction====
{{main|Human–computer interaction}}

Human–computer interaction (HCI) is the field of study and research concerned with the design and use of [[Computer|computer systems]], mainly based on the analysis of the interaction between [[Human|humans]] and [[Interface (computing)|computer interfaces]]. HCI has several [[Human–computer interaction#Current research|subfields]] that focus on the relationship between [[Emotion|emotions]], [[social behavior]] and [[Electroencephalography|brain activity]] with [[Computer|computers]].

====Software engineering====
{{main|Software engineering}}
{{see also|Computer programming}}
Software engineering is the study of designing, implementing, and modifying the software in order to ensure it is of high quality, affordable, maintainable, and fast to build. It is a systematic approach to software design, involving the application of engineering practices to software. Software engineering deals with the organizing and analyzing of software—it does not just deal with the creation or manufacture of new software, but its internal arrangement and maintenance. For example [[software testing]], [[systems engineering]], [[technical debt]] and [[software development process]]es.

====Artificial intelligence====
{{main|Artificial intelligence|Bio-inspired computing}}

Artificial intelligence (AI) aims to or is required to synthesize goal-orientated processes such as problem-solving, decision-making, environmental adaptation, learning, and communication found in humans and animals. From its origins in [[cybernetics]] and in the [[History of artificial intelligence|Dartmouth Conference]] (1956), artificial intelligence research has been necessarily cross-disciplinary, drawing on areas of expertise such as [[applied mathematics]], symbolic logic, [[semiotics]], [[electrical engineering]], [[philosophy of mind]], [[neurophysiology]], and [[social intelligence]]. AI is associated in the popular mind with [[Robotics|robotic development]], but the main field of practical application has been as an embedded component in areas of [[software development]], which require computational understanding. The starting point in the late 1940s was Alan Turing's question "[[Computing Machinery and Intelligence|Can computers think?]]", and the question remains effectively unanswered, although the [[Turing test]] is still used to assess computer output on the scale of human intelligence. But the automation of evaluative and predictive tasks has been increasingly successful as a substitute for human monitoring and intervention in domains of computer application involving complex real-world data.

===Computer systems===

====Computer architecture and microarchitecture====
{{main|Computer architecture|Microarchitecture|Computer engineering}}

Computer architecture, or digital computer organization, is the conceptual design and fundamental operational structure of a computer system. It focuses largely on the way by which the central processing unit performs internally and accesses addresses in memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=A. Thisted|first=Ronald|title=Computer Architecture |url=http://galton.uchicago.edu/~thisted/Distribute/comparch.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/http://galton.uchicago.edu/~thisted/Distribute/comparch.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live|publisher=The University of Chicago|date=April 7, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Computer engineers study [[computational logic]] and design of computer hardware, from individual [[Processor (computing)|processor]] components, [[microcontroller]]s, [[personal computer]]s to [[supercomputer]]s and [[embedded system]]s. The term "architecture" in computer literature can be traced to the work of Lyle R. Johnson and [[Frederick P. Brooks Jr.]], members of the Machine Organization department in IBM's main research center in 1959.

====Concurrent, parallel and distributed computing====
{{main|Concurrency (computer science)|Distributed computing}}
Concurrency is a property of systems in which several computations are executing simultaneously, and potentially interacting with each other.&lt;ref&gt;Jiacun Wang, (2017). ''Real-Time Embedded Systems''. Wiley. p. 12. {{ISBN|978-1-119-42070-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of mathematical models have been developed for general concurrent computation including [[Petri net]]s, [[process calculi]] and the [[parallel random access machine]] model.&lt;ref&gt;Gordana Dodig-Crnkovic; Raffaela Giovagnoli, (2013). ''Computing Nature: Turing Centenary Perspective''. Springer Science &amp; Business Media. p. 247. {{ISBN|978-3-642-37225-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When multiple computers are connected in a network while using concurrency, this is known as a distributed system. Computers within that distributed system have their own private memory, and information can be exchanged to achieve common goals.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Elias Bibri (2018). ''Smart Sustainable Cities of the Future: The Untapped Potential of Big Data Analytics and Context-Aware Computing for Advancing Sustainability''. Springer. p. 74. {{ISBN|978-3-319-73981-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Computer networks====
{{main|Computer network}}
This branch of computer science aims studies the construction and behavior of computer networks. It addresses their performance, resilience, security, scalability, and cost-effectiveness, along with the variety of services they can provide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Peterson |first1=Larry | last2=Davie | first2=Bruce |date=2000 |title=Computer Networks: A Systems Approach |url=https://book.systemsapproach.org/index.html |location=Singapore |publisher=Harcourt Asia  |isbn= 9789814066433 |access-date=May 24, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Computer security and cryptography====
{{main|Computer security|Cryptography}}
Computer security is a branch of computer technology with the objective of protecting information from unauthorized access, disruption, or modification while maintaining the accessibility and usability of the system for its intended users.

Historical [[cryptography]] is the art of writing and deciphering secret messages. Modern cryptography is the scientific study of problems relating to distributed computations that can be attacked.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Katz|first=Jonathan|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/137325053|title=Introduction to modern cryptography|date=2008|publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC|others=Yehuda Lindell|isbn=978-1-58488-551-1|location=Boca Raton|oclc=137325053|access-date=November 17, 2021|archive-date=May 6, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220506003141/http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/137325053|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technologies studied in modern cryptography include symmetric and asymmetric [[encryption]], [[digital signature]]s, [[cryptographic hash function]]s, [[key-agreement protocol]]s, [[blockchain]], [[zero-knowledge proof]]s, and [[garbled circuit]]s.

====Databases and data mining====
{{main|Database|Data mining}}
A database is intended to organize, store, and retrieve large amounts of data easily. Digital databases are managed using database management systems to store, create, maintain, and search data, through [[database model]]s and [[query language]]s. Data mining is a process of discovering patterns in large data sets.

==Discoveries==
The philosopher of computing [[William J. Rapaport|Bill Rapaport]] noted three ''Great Insights of Computer Science'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/computation.html|title=What Is Computation?|publisher=State University of New York at Buffalo|last=Rapaport|first=William J.|date=20 September 2013|access-date=August 31, 2013|archive-date=February 14, 2001|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010214002845/http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/computation.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]'s, [[George Boole]]'s, [[Alan Turing]]'s, [[Claude Shannon]]'s, and [[Samuel Morse]]'s insight: there are only ''two objects'' that a computer has to deal with in order to represent "anything".{{refn |group="note"|The word "anything" is written in quotation marks because there are things that computers cannot do. One example is: to answer the question if an arbitrary given computer program will eventually finish or run forever (the [[Halting problem]]).}}
:: All the information about any computable problem can be represented using only 0 and 1 (or any other bistable pair that can flip-flop between two easily distinguishable states, such as "on/off", "magnetized/de-magnetized", "high-voltage/low-voltage", etc.).
{{see also|Digital physics}}
* [[Alan Turing]]'s insight: there are only ''five actions'' that a computer has to perform in order to do "anything".
:: Every algorithm can be expressed in a language for a computer consisting of only five basic instructions:&lt;ref&gt;B. Jack Copeland, (2012). ''Alan Turing's Electronic Brain: The Struggle to Build the ACE, the World's Fastest Computer''. OUP Oxford. p. 107. {{ISBN|978-0-19-960915-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
::* move left one location;
::* move right one location;
::* read symbol at current location;
::* print 0 at current location;
::* print 1 at current location.
{{see also|Turing machine}}
* [[Corrado Böhm]] and Giuseppe Jacopini's insight: there are only ''three ways of combining'' these actions (into more complex ones) that are needed in order for a computer to do "anything".&lt;ref&gt;Charles W. Herbert, (2010). ''An Introduction to Programming Using Alice 2.2''. Cengage Learning. p. 122. {{ISBN|0-538-47866-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

:: Only three rules are needed to combine any set of basic instructions into more complex ones:
::*''sequence'': first do this, then do that;
::* '' selection'': IF such-and-such is the case, THEN do this, ELSE do that;
::* ''repetition'': WHILE such-and-such is the case, DO this.
:: The three rules of Boehm's and Jacopini's insight can be further simplified with the use of [[goto]] (which means it is more elementary than [[structured programming]]).
{{see also|Structured program theorem}}

==Programming paradigms==
{{main|Programming paradigm}}

Programming languages can be used to accomplish different tasks in different ways. Common programming paradigms include:
* [[Functional programming]], a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids state and mutable data. It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions or declarations instead of statements.&lt;ref&gt;Md. Rezaul Karim; Sridhar Alla, (2017). ''Scala and Spark for Big Data Analytics: Explore the concepts of functional programming, data streaming, and machine learning''. Packt Publishing Ltd. p. 87. {{ISBN|978-1-78355-050-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Imperative programming]], a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state.&lt;ref&gt;Lex Sheehan, (2017). ''Learning Functional Programming in Go: Change the way you approach your applications using functional programming in Go''. Packt Publishing Ltd. p. 16. {{ISBN|978-1-78728-604-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In much the same way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform. Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates.
* [[Object-oriented programming]], a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which may contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods. A feature of objects is that an object's procedures can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated. Thus object-oriented computer programs are made out of objects that interact with one another.&lt;ref&gt;Evelio Padilla, (2015). ''Substation Automation Systems: Design and Implementation''. Wiley. p. 245. {{ISBN|978-1-118-98730-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Service-oriented programming]], a programming paradigm that uses "services" as the unit of computer work, to design and implement integrated business applications and [[mission critical]] software programs.

Many languages offer support for multiple [[Programming paradigm|paradigms]], making the distinction more a matter of style than of technical capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Multi-Paradigm Programming Language |url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/multiparadigmlanguage.html |website=MDN Web Docs |publisher=[[Mozilla Foundation]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821052407/https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/multiparadigmlanguage.html |archive-date=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
{{further|List of computer science conferences|Category:Computer science journals}}
Conferences are important events for computer science research. During these conferences, researchers from the public and private sectors present their recent work and meet. Unlike in most other academic fields, in computer science, the prestige of [[conference papers]] is greater than that of journal publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meyer|first1=Bertrand|title=Viewpoint: Research evaluation for computer science|journal=Communications of the ACM|date=April 2009|volume=25|issue=4|pages=31–34|doi=10.1145/1498765.1498780|s2cid=8625066|url=https://pure.itu.dk/portal/da/publications/b474cea0-8288-11dd-b116-000ea68e967b }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Patterson|first1=David|title=Evaluating Computer Scientists and Engineers For Promotion and Tenure|url=http://cra.org/resources/bp-view/evaluating_computer_scientists_and_engineers_for_promotion_and_tenure/|publisher=Computing Research Association|date=August 1999|access-date=July 19, 2015|archive-date=July 22, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722020941/http://cra.org/resources/bp-view/evaluating_computer_scientists_and_engineers_for_promotion_and_tenure/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; One proposed explanation for this is the quick development of this relatively new field requires rapid review and distribution of results, a task better handled by conferences than by journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fortnow|first1=Lance|title=Viewpoint: Time for Computer Science to Grow Up|journal=Communications of the ACM|date=August 2009|volume=52|issue=8|pages=33–35|doi=10.1145/1536616.1536631|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="6007" sha1="pvr7nfv4blg3h5191maj3avoofbqg8b" xml:space="preserve">'''Prefetching''' is a technique used in [[computing]] to improve performance by retrieving data or instructions before they are needed. By predicting what a program will request in the future, the system can load information in advance to reduced wait times .&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Prefetching is used in various areas of computing, including [[Computer architecture|CPU architectures]] and [[operating system]]s. It can be implemented in both [[Computer hardware|hardware]] and [[software]], and it relies on detecting access patterns that suggest what data is likely to be needed soon.

== Overview ==

Prefetching works by predicting which [[memory address]]es or [[Resource (computer science)|resources]] will be accessing and load them into faster access storage, like [[Cache (computing)|caches]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Prefetching may be used:
* '''Hardware-level''', such as [[Memory controller|CPU memory controllers]]
* '''Software-level''', strategies in [[compiler]]s, operating systems, logic in [[web browser]]s or [[file system]]s

== Hardware ==
Processors (CPU's) often include prefetching that attempts to reduce cache misses by loading data into cache before it is requested by the running program. This is for programs that access memory in predictable patterns, such as loops that iterate over [[Array (data structure)|arrays]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Hardware prefetching is can be done without software involvement and can be found in most modern CPU's. For example, [[Intel]] CPU's feature a variety of prefetch that work across multiple cache levels.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |date=2023-09-05 |title=Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Optimization Reference Manual Volume 1 |url=https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/content-details/671488/intel-64-and-ia-32-architectures-optimization-reference-manual-volume-1.html |access-date=2025-04-24 |website=Intel |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Stride (computer storage)|Stride]]''' prefetching detects constant-stride memory access patterns (fixed distance between consecutive memory accesses)&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Hur |first1=Ibrahim |last2=Lin |first2=Calvin |chapter=Feedback mechanisms for improving probabilistic memory prefetching |date=February 2009 |title=2009 IEEE 15th International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture |chapter-url=https://doi.org/10.1109/hpca.2009.4798282 |publisher=IEEE |pages=443–454 |doi=10.1109/hpca.2009.4798282|isbn=978-1-4244-2932-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Stream computing|'''Stream''']] prefetching identifies long sequences of contiguous memory accesses (sequential access to a block of memory)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* '''Correlation''' prefetching learns patterns between cache misses and triggers prefetches based on those patterns&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Software ==
Prefetch instructions can be written into the code by the programmer or by the compiler. Prefetch instructions specify the memory addresses to be prefetched and the desired prefetch distance.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In software, there are instructions that can be written with:
*&lt;code&gt;prefetch&lt;/code&gt; on [[X86|x86 architecture]]
*&lt;code&gt;__builtin_prefetch&lt;/code&gt; in the [[GCC Compiler|GCC compiler]]
*&lt;code&gt;_mm_prefetch&lt;/code&gt; in the [https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/intrinsics-guide/index.html#text=prefetch Intel Intrinsics Guide]

=== Operating systems ===
Operating systems use prefetching to reduce file and memory access latency.

* [[Memory paging#Anticipatory paging|'''Anticipatory Paging''']], attempts to prefetch [[Page (computer memory)|memory pages]] based on pages in [[Random-access memory|RAM]] and not in RAM

=== Web Browsers ===
Web browsers apply prefetching techniques to improve perceived performance. Common examples include:
* '''[[Domain Name System|DNS prefetching]]''': resolves [[domain name]]s of links likely to be clicked&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2025-04-10 |title=Using dns-prefetch - Web performance {{!}} MDN |url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Guides/dns-prefetch |access-date=2025-04-24 |website=developer.mozilla.org |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Link prefetching]]''': loads linked [[web page]]s or assets before the user clicks them&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2025-04-10 |title=rel=prefetch - HTML: HyperText Markup Language {{!}} MDN |url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/rel/prefetch |access-date=2025-04-24 |website=developer.mozilla.org |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Resource preloading''': fetches critical resources (like [[font]]s or [[Scripting language|scripts]]) in parallel with the current page load&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2025-04-10 |title=rel=preload - HTML: HyperText Markup Language {{!}} MDN |url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/rel/preload |access-date=2025-04-24 |website=developer.mozilla.org |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations ==

Prefetching can significantly improve performance, but it can not always be beneficial if implemented wrong. If predictions are inaccurate, prefetching may waste [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]], processing time, or cause [[cache pollution]]. In systems with limited resources or highly unpredictable workloads, prefetching can degrade performance rather than improve it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Implementing both software and hardware prefetching can also lead to degraded performance because of interactions that might occur between each other from how it was implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Lee |first1=Jaekyu |last2=Kim |first2=Hyesoon |last3=Vuduc |first3=Richard |date=2012-03-01 |title=When Prefetching Works, When It Doesn't, and Why |url=https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2133382.2133384 |journal=ACM Trans. Archit. Code Optim. |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=2:1–2:29 |doi=10.1145/2133382.2133384 |issn=1544-3566}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Computer science in sport''' is an interdisciplinary discipline that has its goal in combining the theoretical as well as practical aspects and methods of the areas of [[Information technology|informatics]] and [[sport science]]. The main emphasis of the [[interdisciplinarity]] is placed on the application and use of computer-based, but also mathematical techniques in sport science, aiming in this way at the support and advancement of theory and practice in sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Link |first1=D. |last2=Lames |first2=M. |title=Sport Informatics - Historical Roots, Interdisciplinarity and Future Developments |journal=International Journal of Computer Science in Sport |date=2009 |volume=8 |issue=Edition 2 |pages=68–87}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason [[computer science]] has become an important partner for sport science is mainly connected with "the fact that the use of data and media, the design of models, the analysis of systems etc. increasingly requires the support of suitable tools and concepts which are developed and available in computer science".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Arnold Baca |title=Computer science in sport: an overview of history, present fields and future applications (part I) |year=2006}} IJCSS Special Edition 2/2006, 25-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical background ==
Going back in history, computers in sports were used for the first time in the 1960s, when the main purpose was to accumulate sports information. [[Database]]s were created and expanded in order to launch documentation and dissemination of publications like articles or books that contain any kind of knowledge related to sports science. Until the mid-1970s also the first organization in this area called IASI (International Association for Sports Information) was formally established. Congresses and meetings were organized more often with the aim of standardization and rationalization of sports documentation. Since at that time this area was obviously less computer-oriented, specialists talk about sports information rather than sports informatics when mentioning the beginning of this field of science.

Based on the progress of computer science and the invention of more powerful computer hardware in the 1970s, also the real history of computer science in sport began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jürgen Perl |title=Computer science in sport: an overview of history, present fields and future applications (part II) |year=2006}} IJCSS Special Edition 2/2006, 36-46.&lt;/ref&gt; This was as well the first time when this term was officially used and the initiation of a very important evolution in sports science.

In the early stages of this area statistics on biomechanical data, like different kinds of forces or rates, played a major role. Scientists started to analyze sports games by collecting and looking at such values and features in order to interpret them. Later on, with the continuous improvement of computer hardware — in particular microprocessor speed – many new scientific and computing paradigms were introduced, which were also integrated in computer science in sport. Specific examples are [[Computer model|modeling]] as well as [[simulation]], but also [[pattern recognition]], and design.

As another result of this development, the term 'computer science in sport' has been added in the encyclopedia of sports science in 2004.

== Areas of research ==
The importance and strong influence of computer science as an interdisciplinary partner for sport and sport science is mainly proven by the research activities in computer science in sport. The following IT concepts are thereby of particular interest:

* [[Data acquisition]] and [[data processing]]
* Databases and [[expert system]]s
* Modelling (mathematical, IT based, biomechanical, physiological)
* Simulation (interactive, animation etc.)
* Presentation

Based on the fields from above, the main areas of research in computer science in sport include amongst others:

* [[Training]] and coaching
* [[Biomechanics]]
* [[Sports equipment]] and technology
* Computer-aided applications (software, hardware) in sports
* [[Ubiquitous computing]] in sports
* [[Multimedia]] and [[Internet]]
* Documentation
* Education

== Research communities ==
A clear demonstration for the evolution and propagation towards computer science in sport is also the fact that nowadays people do research in this area all over the world. Since the 1990s, many new national and international organizations regarding the topic of computer science in sport were established. These associations are regularly organizing congresses and workshops with the aim of dissemination as well as exchange of scientific knowledge and information on all sort of topics regarding the interdisciplinary discipline.

=== Historical survey ===
As a first example, in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] scientists have built up the MathSport group of [[ANZIAM]] (Australia and New Zealand Industrial and Applied Mathematics), which since 1992 organizes biennial meetings, initially under the name "Mathematics and Computers in Sport Conferences", and now "[[MathSport]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anziam.org.au/MathSport MathSport], www.anziam.org.au&lt;/ref&gt; Main topics are mathematical models and computer applications in sports, as well as coaching and teaching methods based on informatics.

The European community was also amongst the leading motors of the emergence of the field. Some workshops on this topic were successfully organized in Germany since the late 1980s. In 1997 the first international meeting on computer science in sport was held in Cologne. The main aim was to spread out and share applications, ideas and concepts of the use of computers in sports, which should also make a contribution to the creation of internationalization and thus to boost research work in this area.

Since then, such international symposia took place every two years all over Europe. As the first conferences were a raving success, it was decided to go even further and the foundation of an organization was the logical consequence. This step was accomplished in 2003, when the International Association of Computer Science in Sport (IACSS) was established during the 4th international symposium in Barcelona, when Prof. Jürgen Perl was also chosen as the first president. A few years earlier, the first international e-journal on this topic (International Journal of Computer Science in Sport) was released already. The internationalization is confirmed moreover by the fact that three conferences already took place outside of Europe - in [[Calgary]] ([[Canada]]) in 2007, [[Canberra]] ([[Australia]]) in 2009 and [[Shanghai]] ([[China]]) in 2011. During the symposium in Calgary additionally, the president position changed - it has been assigned to Prof. Arnold Baca, who has been re-elected in 2009 and 2011. The following Symposia on Computer Science in Sport took place in Europe again, in [[Istanbul]] ([[Turkey]]) in 2013 and in [[Loughborough]] ([[UK]]) in 2015. In 2017 the 11th Symposium of Computer Science in Sport took place in [[Konstanz|Constance]] ([[Germany]]). During the conference in Istanbul Prof. Martin Lames was elected as president of the IACSS. He was re-elected in 2015, 2017 and 2019.
The 12th International Symposium of Computer Science in Sports was held in [[Moscow]] ([[Russia]]) from 8 to 10 July 2019: https://iacss2019.ru/

=== National organizations ===
In addition to the international associations from above, currently the following national associations on computer science in sport exist (if available, the web addresses are also given):

* Austrian Association of Computer Science in Sport - http://www.sportinformatik.at
* British Association of Computer Science in Sport and Exercise

Abstractions are fundamental building blocks of computer science, enabling complex systems and ideas to be simplified into more manageable and relatable concepts.

== General Programming Abstractions ==
General programming abstractions are foundational concepts that underlie virtually all of the programming tasks that software developers engage in. By providing a layer of separation from the specifics of the underlying hardware and system details, these abstractions allow for the creation of complex logic in a more approachable and manageable form. They emerge as a consensus on best practices for expressing and solving programming problems in efficient and logically sound ways. From the simplicity of a variable to the structured flow of control structures, these abstractions are the building blocks that constitute high-level programming languages and give rise to detailed software implementations.

== Data Structures ==
In the context of data structures, the term "abstraction" refers to the way in which a data structure represents and organizes data. Each data structure provides a particular way of organizing data in memory so that it can be accessed and modified according to specific rules. The data structure itself is an abstraction because it hides the details of how the data is stored in memory and provides a set of operations or interfaces for working with the data (e.g., push and pop for a stack, insert and delete for a binary search tree).

== Functional Programming Abstractions ==
In the world of functional programming, abstraction is not just a tool but a core principle that influences the entire programming model. The abstractions used in functional programming are designed to enhance expressiveness, provide greater modularity, and enable transformative operations that are both concise and predictable. By treating computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions, functional programming moves away from the mutable state and side effects that are typical in imperative programming, presenting a declarative approach to problem-solving.

== Concurrency Models ==
Concurrency models are critical abstractions in computer science that facilitate the management of multiple processes or threads executing simultaneously. These models provide the architectural framework needed to handle concurrent operations efficiently and safely in applications ranging from operating systems to high-throughput data processing and network servers. The key challenge they address is the coordination of computational tasks that can potentially interfere with one another, ensuring data integrity and optimizing resource usage without sacrificing performance.

== Design Patterns ==
Design patterns in computer science represent abstract solutions to common software design problems. While they are not abstractions in the same sense as data structures or mathematical concepts, design patterns provide a high-level language for software developers to communicate and implement solutions in a consistent and recognizable way.

Each design pattern abstracts the complexity of a particular design scenario or problem by providing a tested, proven development paradigm.

{| class="wikitable sortable"

'''Transition''' refers to a computer science paradigm in the context of [[communication systems]] which describes the change of communication mechanisms, i.e., functions of a communication system, in particular, service and [[Communications protocol|protocol]] components. In a transition, communication mechanisms within a system are replaced by functionally comparable mechanisms with the aim to ensure the highest possible quality, e.g., as captured by the [[quality of service]].

[[File:Transition en-05.png|alt=|thumb|Transitions and the subsequent adaptation of communication systems enable the optimization of g conditions.]]
Transitions enable communication systems to adapt to changing conditions during runtime. This change in conditions can, for example, be a rapid increase in the load on a certain service that may be caused, e.g., by large gatherings of people with mobile devices. A transition often impacts multiple mechanisms at different communication layers of a [[OSI model|layered architecture]].

Mechanisms are given as conceptual elements of a networked communication system and are linked to specific functional units, for example, as a service or protocol component. In some cases, a mechanism can also comprise an entire protocol. For example on the transmission layer, LTE can be regarded as such a mechanism. Following this definition, there exist numerous communication mechanisms that are partly equivalent in their basic functionality, such as [[Wi-Fi]], [[Bluetooth]] and [[Zigbee]] for local wireless networks and UMTS and [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] for broadband wireless connections. For example, LTE and Wi-Fi have equivalent basic functionality, but they are technologically significantly different in their design and operation. Mechanisms affected by transitions are often components of a protocol or service. For example, in case of video streaming/transmission, the use of different video data encoding can be carried out depending on the available data transmission rate. These changes are controlled and implemented by transitions; A research example is a context-aware video adaptation service to support mobile video applications.&lt;ref&gt;S. Wilk, D. Stohr, and W. Effelsberg. 2016. A Content-Aware Video Adaptation Service to Support Mobile Video. ACM Trans. Multimedia Comput. Commun. Appl. 12, 5s, Article 82 (November 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; Through analyzing the current processes in a communication system, it is possible to determine which transitions need to be executed at which communication layer in order to meet the quality requirements. In order for communication systems to adapt to the respective framework conditions, architectural approaches of self-organizing, adaptive systems can be used, such as the MAPE cycle &lt;ref&gt;JO Kephart and DM Chess. The vision of autonomous computing. IEEE Computer, 1, pp. 41-50, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; (Monitor-Analyze-Plan-Execute). This central concept of [[Autonomic computing|Autonomic Computing]] can be used to determine the state of the communication system, to analyze the monitoring data and to plan and execute the necessary transition(s). A central goal is that users do not consciously perceive a transition while running applications and that the functionality of the used services is perceived as smooth and fluid.

== Recent research ==
The study of new and fundamental design methods, models and techniques that enable automated, coordinated and cross-layer transitions between functionally similar mechanisms within a communication system is the main goal of a collaborative research center funded by the German research foundation (DFG). The DFG collaborative research center 1053 MAKI - Multi-mechanism Adaptation for the future Internet - focuses on research questions in the following areas: (i) Fundamental research on transition methods, (ii) Techniques for adapting transition-capable communication systems on the basis of achieved and targeted quality, and (iii) specific and exemplary transitions in communication systems as regarded from different technical perspectives.

A formalization of the concept of transitions that captures the features and relations within a communication system to express and optimize the decision making process that is associated with such a system is given in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Alt|first1=Bastian|last2=Weckesser|first2=Markus|last3=Becker|first3=Christian|last4=Hollick|first4=Matthias|last5=Kar|first5=Sounak|last6=Klein|first6=Anja|last7=Klose|first7=Robin|last8=Kluge|first8=Roland|last9=Koeppl|first9=Heinz|display-authors=2|date=2019|title=Transitions: A Protocol-Independent View of the Future Internet|journal=Proceedings of the IEEE|volume=107|issue=4|pages=835–846|doi=10.1109/JPROC.2019.2895964|s2cid=86852058|issn=0018-9219}}&lt;/ref&gt; The associated building blocks comprise (i) Dynamic [[Software product line|Software Product Lines]], (ii) [[Markov decision process|Markov Decision Processes]] and (iii) [[Utility]] Design. While Dynamic Software Product Lines provide a method to concisely capture a large configuration space and to specify run time variability of adaptive systems, Markov Decision Processes provide a mathematical tool to define and plan transitions between available communication mechanisms. Finally, utility functions quantify the performance of individual configurations of the transition-based communication system and provide the means to optimize the performance in such a system.

* {{Harvnb|Poole|Mackworth|Goebel|1998|loc=[http://people.cs.ubc.ca/~poole/ci/ch1.pdf p. 1]}}, which provides the version that is used in this article. Note that they use the term "computational intelligence" as a synonym for artificial intelligence.
* {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2003}} (who prefer the term "rational agent") and write "The whole-agent view is now widely accepted in the field" {{Harv|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=55}}.

&lt;!--These textbooks are the most widely used in academic AI.--&gt;

{{term|[[encryption]]}}
{{defn|In [[cryptography]], encryption is the process of [[Data compression|encoding]] information. This process converts the original representation of the information, known as [[plaintext]], into an alternative form known as [[ciphertext]]. Ideally, only authorized parties can decipher a ciphertext back to plaintext and access the original information. Encryption does not itself prevent interference but denies the intelligible content to a would-be interceptor. For technical reasons, an encryption scheme usually uses a [[pseudo-random]] encryption [[Key (cryptography)|key]] generated by an [[algorithm]]. It is possible to decrypt the message without possessing the key, but, for a well-designed encryption scheme, considerable computational resources and skills are required. An authorized recipient can easily decrypt the message with the key provided by the originator to recipients but not to unauthorized users. Historically, various forms of encryption have been used to aid in cryptography. Early encryption techniques were often utilized in military messaging. Since then, new techniques have emerged and become commonplace in all areas of modern computing.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kessler|first=Gary|date=November 17, 2006|title=An Overview of Cryptography|url=https://www.garykessler.net/library/crypto.html|journal=Princeton University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern encryption schemes utilize the concepts of [[public-key]] and [[symmetric-key]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Modern encryption techniques ensure security because modern computers are inefficient at cracking the encryption.}}

{{term|[[semantics (computer science)|semantics]]}}
{{defn|In [[programming language theory]], semantics is the field concerned with the rigorous mathematical study of the meaning of [[programming language]]s.

{{term|[[sequence]]}}
{{defn|In [[mathematics]], a sequence is an enumerated collection of objects in which repetitions are allowed and [[order theory|order]] does matter.  Like a [[Set (mathematics)|set]], it contains [[Element (mathematics)|members]] (also called ''elements'', or ''terms'').  The number of elements (possibly infinite) is called the ''length'' of the sequence.  Unlike a set, the same elements can appear multiple times at different positions in a sequence, and order does matter.  Formally, a sequence can be defined as a [[function (mathematics)|function]] whose domain is either the set of the [[natural number]]s (for infinite sequences) or the set of the first ''n'' natural numbers (for a sequence of finite length ''n'').

The position of an element in a sequence is its ''rank'' or ''index''; it is the natural number for which the element is the image. The first element has index 0 or 1, depending on the context or a specific convention.  When a symbol is used to denote a sequence, the ''n''th element of the sequence is denoted by this symbol with ''n'' as subscript; for example, the ''n''th element of the [[Fibonacci sequence]] ''F'' is generally denoted ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.

For example, (M, A, R, Y) is a sequence of letters with the letter 'M' first and 'Y' last.  This sequence differs from (A, R, M, Y).  Also, the sequence (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8), which contains the number 1 at two different positions, is a valid sequence.  Sequences can be ''[[finite set|finite]]'', as in these examples, or ''[[Infinite set|infinite]]'', such as the sequence of all [[even and odd numbers|even]] [[positive integer]]s (2, 4, 6, ...).  In [[computing]] and [[computer science]], finite sequences are sometimes called [[string (computer science)|strings]], [[word (formal language theory)|words]] or [[list (computer science)|lists]], the different names commonly corresponding to different ways to represent them in [[computer memory]]; infinite sequences are called [[stream (computing)|streams]].  The empty sequence&amp;nbsp;(&amp;nbsp;) is included in most notions of sequence, but may be excluded depending on the context.}}

Serializability is the major correctness criterion for concurrent transactions' executions{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}. It is considered the highest level of [[isolation (computer science)|isolation]] between [[Database transaction|transactions]], and plays an essential role in [[concurrency control]]. As such it is supported in all general purpose database systems.

{{term|[[sorting algorithm]]}}
{{defn|Is an [[algorithm]] that puts elements of a [[List (computing)|list]] in a certain [[Total order|order]]. The most frequently used orders are [[numerical order]] and [[lexicographical order]]. Efficient [[sorting]] is important for optimizing the [[Algorithmic efficiency|efficiency]] of other algorithms (such as [[search algorithm|search]] and [[merge algorithm|merge]] algorithms) that require input data to be in sorted lists. Sorting is also often useful for [[Canonicalization|canonicalizing]] data and for producing human-readable output. More formally, the output of any sorting algorithm must satisfy two conditions:

# The output is in nondecreasing order (each element is no smaller than the previous element according to the desired [[total order]]);&lt;!-- confusing; this appears to mean that the output must be in ascending order, which isn't a necessary condition --&gt;
# The output is a [[permutation]] (a reordering, yet retaining all of the original elements) of the input.

Further, the input data is often stored in an [[Array data type|array]], which allows [[random access]], rather than a list, which only allows [[sequential access]]; though many algorithms can be applied to either type of data after suitable modification.

{{term|[[stack (abstract data type)|stack]]}}
{{defn|Is an [[abstract data type]] that serves as a [[collection (abstract data type)|collection]] of elements, with two main principal operations:
* {{visible anchor|push}}, which adds an element to the collection, and 
* {{visible anchor|pop}}, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.
The order in which elements come off a stack gives rise to its alternative name, LIFO (last in, first out). Additionally, a [[peek (data type operation)|peek]] operation may give access to the top without modifying the stack.&lt;ref&gt;By contrast, a simple QUEUE operates FIFO ([[FIFO (computing and electronics)|first in, first out]]).&lt;/ref&gt; The name "stack" for this type of structure comes from the analogy to a set of physical items stacked on top of each other. This structure makes it easy to take an item off the top of the stack, while getting to an item deeper in the stack may require taking off multiple other items first.&lt;ref name="clrs_pages_232-233"&gt;{{Introduction to Algorithms|3|pages=232–233}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In computing, a device or software program is said to be '''agnostic''' or '''data agnostic''' if the method or [[file format|format]] of data transmission is irrelevant to the device or program's function. This means that the device or program can receive data in multiple formats or from multiple sources, and still process that data effectively.

==Definition==

Many devices or programs need data to be presented in a specific format to process the data. For example, [[Apple Inc]] devices generally require applications to be downloaded from their [[App Store]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Costello |first1=Sam |title=How to Get Apps That Are Not In The App Store |url=https://www.lifewire.com/get-apps-not-in-app-store-1999916 |website=Lifewire |access-date=4 February 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a non data-agnostic method, as it uses a specified file type, downloaded from a specific location, and does not function unless those requirements are met.

Non data-agnostic devices and programs can present problems. For example, if your file contains the right type of data (such as text), but in the wrong format, you may have to create a new file and enter the text manually in the proper format in order to use that program. Various file conversion programs exist because people need to convert their files to a different format in order to use them effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Free Online File Converter |url=https://www.online-convert.com/ |access-date=4 February 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cloud Convert File Converter |url=https://cloudconvert.com/ |access-date=4 February 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Convertio File Converter |url=https://convertio.co/ |access-date=4 February 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Free Tools File Converter |url=https://freetools.site/ |access-date=28 September 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==

Data agnostic devices and programs work to solve these problems in a variety of ways. Devices can treat files in the same way whether they are downloaded over the internet or transferred over a [[USB]] or other cable.

Devices and programs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What Are Data Agnostic Services (DAS)? |url=https://greatideaz.com/Daas/DataAsService |website=Great Ideaz |access-date=4 February 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; can become more data-agnostic by using a generic storage format to [[create, read, update and delete]] files. Formats like [[XML]] and [[JSON]] can store information in a data agnostic manner. For example, [[XML]] is data agnostic in that it can save any type of information. However, if you use Data Transform Definitions (DTD) or XML Schema Definitions (XSD) to define what data should be placed where, it becomes non-data agnostic; it produces an error if the wrong type of data is placed in a field.

Once you have your data saved in a generic storage format, this source can act as an entity synchronization layer. The generic storage format can interface with a variety of different programs, with the data extraction method formatting the data in a way that the specific program can understand. This allows two programs that require different data formats to access the same data. Multiple devices and programs can [[create, read, update and delete]] (CRUD) the same information from the same storage location without formatting errors.

When multiple programs are accessing the same records, they may have different defined fields for the same type of concept. Where the fields are differently labelled but contain the same data, the program pulling the information can ensure the correct data is used. If one program contains fields and information that another does not, those fields can be saved to the record and pulled for that program, but ignored by other programs. As the entity synchronization layer is data agnostic, additional fields can be added without worrying about recoding the whole database, and concepts created in other programs (that do not contain that field) are fine.

Since the information formatting is imposed on the data by the program extracting it, the format can be customized to the device or program extracting and displaying that data. The information extracted from the entity synchronization layer can therefore be dynamically rendered to display on the user's device, regardless of the device or program being used.

Having data agnostic devices and programs allows you to transfer data easily between them, without having to convert that data. Companies like Great Ideaz&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=trellispark Breakthroughs |url=https://greatideaz.com/Breakthroughs |website=Great Ideaz |access-date=4 February 2021 |archive-date=9 February 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210209055714/https://greatideaz.com/Breakthroughs |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; provide data agnostic services by storing the data in an entity synchronization layer. This acts as a compatibility layer, as [[TSQL]] statements can retrieve, update, sort, and write data regardless of the format employed. It also allows you to synchronize data between multiple applications, as the applications can all pull data from the same location. This prevents compatibility problems between different programs that have to access the same data, as well as reducing data replication.

==Benefits ==

Keeping your devices and programs as data agnostic as possible has some clear advantages.
Since the data is stored in an agnostic format, developers do not need to hard-code ways to deal with all different kinds of data. A table with information about dogs and one with information about cats can be treated in the same way; extract the field definitions and the field content from the data agnostic storage format and display it based on the field definitions. Using the same code for the different concepts to [[CRUD]], the amount of code is significantly reduced, and what remains is tested with each concept you extract from the entity synchronization layer.

The field definitions and formatting can be stored in the entity synchronization layer with the data they are acting on. Allows fields and formatting to change, without having to hardcode and compile programs. The data and formatting are then generated dynamically by the code used to extract the data and the formatting information.

The data itself only needs to be distinguished when it is being acted on or displayed in a specific way. If the data is being transferred between devices or databases, it does not need to be interpreted as a specific object. Whenever the data can be treated as agnostic, the coding is simplified, as it only has to deal with one case (the data agnostic case) rather than multiple ([[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], [[PDF]], etc.). When the data must be displayed or acted on, then it is interpreted based on the field definitions and formatting information, and returned to a data agnostic format as soon as possible to reduce the number of individual cases that must be accounted for.

==Risks==

There are, however, a few problems introduced when attempting to make a device or program data agnostic.
Since only one piece of code is being used for [[Create, read, update and delete|CRUD]] operations (regardless of the type of concept), there is a [[single point of failure]]. If that code breaks down, the whole system is broken. This risk is mitigated because the code is tested so many times (as it is used every time a record is stored or retrieved).

Additionally, data agnostic storage mediums can increase load speed, as the code has to search for the field definitions and display format as well as the specific data to be displayed. The load speed can be improved by pre-shredding the data. This uses a copy of the record with the data already extracted to index the fields, instead of having to extract the fields and formatting information at the same time as the data. While this improves the speed, it adds a non-data agnostic element to the process; however, it can be created easily through [[code generation (compiler)|code generation]].
