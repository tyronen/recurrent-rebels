## 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

a. look for cues

- Rasched/Nick, exploring for features in SQL/Pandas
- How to embed users? use something like Node2Vec or other graph embeddings

b. understand the distributions

c. data quality issues

- Anton, notebook connecting to SQL

## 2. Build prediction models

To run the word2vec code, run python word2vec.py from the command line. Or use the notebook word2vec.ipynb, which wraps it, on Google Colab. This produces cbow_text8.pt embeddings.

c. finetune embeddings

d. regression task

## 3. Deploy a predictor service

a. grab a server on Computa

b. run Docker container

c. respond to live requests
