You&amp;#x27;d be almost as happy eating linguine with pesto, but you happen to have a slight preference for spaghetti carbonara. Now you move somewhere else where, for whatever reason, spaghetti is 100x the price and every other ingredient is only 2x the price. Are you suddenly 100x poorer? No, much nearer 2x, because you&amp;#x27;ll just switch from spaghetti to linguine. You&amp;#x27;ll be slightly worse off than 2x because, darn it, you &lt;i&gt;preferred&lt;/i&gt; spaghetti, but only slightly.&lt;p&gt;Moving to San Francisco from (say) Minnesota is a bit like that. Housing is a bajillion times more expensive, so you&amp;#x27;ll have to make do with a lot less of it, but unless housing is the only thing you care about that doesn&amp;#x27;t mean you&amp;#x27;re a bajillion times worse off. You do need some housing, and many other things are also more expensive, so there&amp;#x27;s no argument that you&amp;#x27;re worse off in SF for any given level of income. But &lt;i&gt;not by the factor the price of housing would suggest&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;p&gt;(A couple of other remarks about this sort of comparison. 1. The richer you are, the less these things matter -- if you&amp;#x27;re putting a substantial fraction of your income into investments, &lt;i&gt;those&lt;/i&gt; don&amp;#x27;t change in price at all just because you move to San Francisco. 2. Relatedly, if you are able to buy a house rather than renting, you&amp;#x27;re not as much worse off as the eyewatering price of the house would suggest -- because later on you can move out of San Francisco, sell that house, and get the money back again.)</td>\n",

See sibling post about NASA annual budget, relatively small though it is, still blowing away SpaceX&#x27;s market cap and Elon&#x27;s personal wealth.<p>Elon also hasn&#x27;t just blown money senselessly on longshots or unsustainable one-offs, like a private Mars mission would be. SpaceX and Tesla both have some innovative concepts and have advanced their respective fields, but both are also perfectly ordinary businesses in most regards, with very reasonable plans for revenue. I don&#x27;t see any potential for revenue in travelling to Mars.   \n",
       "4  I agree that there&#x27;s a big transparency benefit to using the same basket everywhere, but I don&#x27;t think that actually gives the most realistic answer.<p>Imagine that every day, for every meal, you eat spaghetti carbonara. You&#x27;d be almost as happy eating linguine with pesto, but you happen to have a slight preference for spaghetti carbonara. Now you move somewhere else where, for whatever reason, spaghetti is 100x the price and every other ingredient is only 2x the price. Are you suddenly 100x poorer? No, much nearer 2x, because you&#x27;ll just switch from spaghetti to linguine. You&#x27;ll be slightly worse off than 2x because, darn it, you <i>preferred</i> spaghetti, but only slightly.<p>Moving to San Francisco from (say) Minnesota is a bit like that. Housing is a bajillion times more expensive, so you&#x27;ll have to make do with a lot less of it, but unless housing is the only thing you care about that doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re a bajillion times worse off. You do need some housing, and many other things are also more expensive, so there&#x27;s no argument that you&#x27;re worse off in SF for any given level of income. But <i>not by the factor the price of housing would suggest</i>.<p>(A couple of other remarks about this sort of comparison. 1. The richer you are, the less these things matter -- if you&#x27;re putting a substantial fraction of your income into investments, <i>those</i> don&#x27;t change in price at all just because you move to San Francisco. 2. Relatedly, if you are able to buy a house rather than renting, you&#x27;re not as much worse off as the eyewatering price of the house would suggest -- because later on you can move out of San Francisco, sell that house, and get the money back again.)   \n",

Solar system&#x27;s escape velocity is 42 km&#x2F;s at Earth&#x27;s orbit.  By the very definition, any A-&gt;B travel for any A and B within the solar system, requires less delta-V if Hoffman&#x27;s orbits are used.<p>In reality the delta-V for Earth_surface -&gt; Mars_surface journey is between 19 and 21 km&#x2F;s (depending on the relative position of the two bodies) for Hoffman&#x27;s orbits.  Without using aerobreaking.  If using aerobreaking, it&#x27;s less by about 3-4km&#x2F;s [1]<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta-v_budget\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Delta-v_budget</a>   \n",
